## üö¶ Project Status & Progress Summary

- **Core web app, worker, and MCP integration:** Complete and production-ready.
- **Frontend:** Pixel-perfect, modern, and fully integrated with backend.
- **Dockerization:** Fully cross-platform (Mac/Windows/Linux), tested via Docker Compose.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow runs lint, tests, and only builds Docker image on success.
- **Automated Tests:** Basic API and job submission tests in place; further endpoint coverage recommended.
- **Documentation:** README and this plan.md are up-to-date for handoff; ARCHITECTURE.md replaced by this file per user preference.
- **File Cleanup:** All legacy and stray files removed; project structure is clean.
- **Ready for:** End-to-end Docker test and handoff to next developer if needed.

## üìù Handoff Notes for Future Developers

### 1. **Architecture Overview**
- **Web:** FastAPI app, serves static frontend, exposes `/api` endpoints, and mounts MCP server at `/mcp`.
- **Worker:** Celery worker, runs `run_packaging_job` from core logic.
- **Redis:** Message broker and result backend for Celery.
- **Volumes:** `outputs` and `temp_uploads` are shared via Docker Compose.

### 2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Jobs: `lint` ‚Üí `test` ‚Üí `build-and-push-image` (in order, only on success).
- Tests must pass before Docker image is built/pushed.

### 3. **Testing**
- Tests in `web_app/tests/`.
- Run with `pytest` after installing both `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`.
- Celery is mocked in tests for speed and isolation.
- Expand coverage for `/status`, `/download`, and `/mcp` endpoints as needed.

### 4. **Common Pitfalls**
- **Volume Paths:** All file I/O is relative to `/app` in containers. If you change Docker Compose, update paths accordingly.
- **Celery Broker URL:** Hardcoded as `redis://redis:6379/0` (matches service name in Docker Compose).
- **MCP Security:** `allow_local_files=True` is safe for local, not for public deployment.
- **Frontend/Backend Sync:** Any changes to backend `JobSettings` schema must be reflected in the frontend form.

### 5. **Extending the Project**
- Add new endpoints: update both backend and frontend, and add tests.
- Add new MCP tools: register them in `mcp_tools.py` and test via `/mcp`.
- For persistent job history, connect a database and update models accordingly.

### 6. **Manual End-to-End Test**
- Build and run with `docker-compose up --build`.
- Visit `http://localhost:8000` in browser.
- Upload photos, configure settings, submit job.
- Wait for processing, then download results.
- Confirm all steps work as expected.

## üìå Outstanding TODOs / Recommendations

- [ ] Add/expand automated tests for all API and MCP endpoints
- [ ] Consider adding authentication for MCP server if deployed beyond localhost
- [ ] Document how to add new Celery tasks/tools
- [ ] (Optional) Add persistent job storage (DB)
- [ ] (Optional) Add user authentication and job history UI
