## üéØ Overview: Solving the Modern Photographer's Delivery Dilemma

**PhotoPackager** is a professional-grade desktop application meticulously engineered by **Steven Seagondollar** at **DropShock Digital LLC**. It's designed to automate and radically streamline the often complex, time-consuming, and error-prone post-production workflow for photographers, creative studios, and marketing agencies.

In today's high-resolution digital landscape, photographers capture stunning detail, resulting in original image files (RAWs or full-quality JPEGs) that can easily be 20MB, 50MB, or even 100MB+ *each*. While these pristine files are essential for archival, professional printing, and intensive re-editing, they present significant challenges when it comes to client delivery and everyday usability:

*   ü§Ø **Client Overwhelm & Storage Woes:** Most clients, whether large commercial entities or individual consumers, lack the robust local storage, high-speed internet, or technical expertise to comfortably handle hundreds or thousands of massive image files. Downloading, storing, and managing gigabytes (or terabytes!) of photos can quickly overwhelm their devices (smartphones, laptops), clog cloud storage, and lead to frustration.
*   üêå **Usability Barriers & Poor Experience:** Large files are slow to download, cumbersome to share on social media, impossible to attach to standard emails, and can make website galleries sluggish, resulting in a subpar experience for the end-user who simply wants to enjoy and utilize their images.
*   üß© **The Multi-Version Nightmare:** Different use cases demand different image specifications. A large-format print requires maximum resolution, a website needs lightweight and fast-loading images, social media platforms have their own optimization preferences, and a quick client preview for selection needs to be easily accessible on any device. Manually creating, naming, and organizing all these variants for every shoot is a monumental, repetitive, and soul-crushing task.

**PhotoPackager is the elegant, automated solution to these critical pain points.** It empowers you to:

1.  **üóÇÔ∏è Organize Intelligently:** Automatically arrange shoots into a standardized, professional, and easily configurable folder structure, bringing order to chaos.
2.  **‚öôÔ∏è Process Versatility:** Generate multiple, purpose-driven delivery formats from your source images in one go:
    *   **Originals:** Safely copied or moved for archival/print.
    *   **Optimized Versions (JPG/WebP):** Beautifully balanced for exceptional visual fidelity at significantly reduced file sizes, perfect for high-quality digital delivery, client galleries, and general use.
    *   **Compressed Versions (JPG/WebP):** Further resized and compressed for maximum portability, ideal for web galleries, email attachments, social media, and quick client previews where file size is paramount.
3.  **üè∑Ô∏è Manage Metadata Consistently:** Ensure EXIF metadata is handled intentionally and uniformly across all generated files, whether preserving it, stripping it for privacy, or retaining specific tags.
4.  **üî¢ Rename with Clarity:** Implement consistent, sequential file renaming (`001-ShootBaseName.ext`, `002-ShootBaseName.ext`, etc.) for unparalleled clarity and effortless sorting in client deliverables.
5.  **üéÅ Package with Professional Branding:** Assemble everything into polished, client-ready packages, complete with a customizable `README.txt` file featuring *your* studio's name, website, and contact email, reinforcing your brand identity.

PhotoPackager emphasizes **efficiency, reliability, operational safety, and producing outputs that reflect the high-quality standards synonymous with the DropShock Digital brand.** Configure it once via the `config.py` file to match your studio's defaults, then process shoots quickly, consistently, and with confidence. Deliver results that not only showcase the premium quality of your work but also provide your clients with conveniently sized, perfectly organized, and easily usable files, upholding the DropShock Digital standard of excellence and client satisfaction.

## ‚ú® Key Features: Your All-in-One Delivery Powerhouse

PhotoPackager comes loaded with features meticulously designed to conquer the challenges of the modern photographic workflow:

*   **üñ•Ô∏è Intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
    A sleek, modern, and exceptionally easy-to-use desktop application built with PySide6. Allows for straightforward configuration and execution of complex processing jobs with just a few clicks. Ideal for daily studio use, requiring minimal learning curve.

*   **‚å®Ô∏è Powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
    A non-interactive CLI (`main.py` with `argparse`) enabling advanced scripting, automation, and batch processing for power users, technical teams, and integration into larger automated workflows (e.g., server-side processing).

*   **üìÇ Standardized & Highly Configurable Output Structure:**
    Automatically generates a consistent, professional, and client-friendly folder hierarchy for each shoot. Default structure includes: `Export Originals`, `Optimized Files/Optimized JPGs`, `Optimized Files/Optimized WebPs`, `Compressed Files/Compressed JPGs`, `Compressed Files/Compressed WebPs`. All folder names are fully customizable in `config.py` to match your studio's specific branding or organizational needs.

*   **üñºÔ∏è Multi-Format Image Generation Engine:**
    The core of PhotoPackager, creating multiple, purpose-driven versions from your source files:
    *   **Optimized Versions:** Produces high-quality JPEGs and/or WebPs, carefully balanced using configurable quality settings (e.g., 85-95 for JPEGs) to retain excellent visual detail while significantly reducing file sizes (often 50-80% smaller than originals). Perfect for primary digital delivery and general client use.
    *   **Compressed Versions:** Generates further resized (to a configurable target pixel count, e.g., 2048px on the long edge or a total megapixel target) and compressed JPEGs and/or WebPs. These are ideal for web galleries, email attachments, social media sharing, and fast client previews, offering dramatic file size reductions (often 90-98% smaller than originals).
    *   *Granular Control:* Easily toggle JPG/WebP generation for each category (Optimized, Compressed) and choose to skip compressed versions entirely via GUI or CLI. Quality settings, resizing parameters, and WebP compression effort levels are all configurable in `config.py`.

*   **üõ°Ô∏è Configurable & Safe Originals Handling:**
    Provides flexible and, above all, safe options for managing your precious source image files:
    *   `Copy`: (Default & Strongly Recommended) Safely duplicates your original files into the `Export Originals` folder within the output package, leaving your master source images completely untouched in their original location.
    *   `Move`: (**EXTREMELY HIGH RISK ‚Äì USE WITH UTMOST CAUTION**) Permanently moves original files from their source location to the `Export Originals` folder. **This is a destructive operation.** *Only use this option after verifying robust, independent, and recently tested backups of your source files.*
    *   `Leave`: Originals remain untouched in their source folder; no copies or moves are made into the `Export Originals` folder in the output structure. Useful if originals are managed separately.
    *   `Skip Export`: Ignores original files entirely during processing; no `Export Originals` folder is created. Useful if only the processed (Optimized/Compressed) versions are needed for a specific delivery.

*   **üè∑Ô∏è Granular EXIF Metadata Control:**
    Offers precise, configurable control over how EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) metadata is handled in *generated* (Optimized and Compressed) images:
    *   `Keep`: (Default) Retains all original EXIF metadata from the source file.
    *   `Strip All`: Removes all EXIF data entirely from the generated images. Useful for maximizing privacy or achieving the smallest possible file sizes.
    *   `Date Only`: Selectively removes only date/time related EXIF tags (requires the optional `piexif` library).
    *   `Camera Only`: Selectively removes only camera make/model and lens information related EXIF tags (requires optional `piexif` library).
    *   `Date & Camera`: Removes both date/time and camera/lens related EXIF tags (requires optional `piexif` library).

*   **üî¢ Consistent Sequential File Renaming:**
    Systematically renames all output files (Optimized, Compressed, and any copied/moved Originals) to a clear, consistent, and sortable `###-<ShootBaseName>.ext` format (e.g., `001-Johnson_Family_Portraits_2025.jpg`, `002-Johnson_Family_Portraits_2025.webp`). The `Shoot Base Name` is provided by you for each job, ensuring easy identification and professional presentation for your clients.

*   **üè¢ Customizable Delivery Branding for *Your* Studio:**
    Empower your brand with personalized client deliverables:
    *   Set **your own** `Company Name`, `Website`, and `Support Email` via the GUI or CLI on a per-job basis.
    *   This information is automatically embedded prominently in the client-facing `README.txt` file that is included in the final delivery package.
    *   Allows for highly personalized client deliveries that feature *your* studio's brand, building recognition and trust. (Developer attribution respectfully remains in the footer of generated files as per license).

*   **üì¶ Automatic Multi-ZIP Archiving:**
    Optionally creates up to three distinct `.zip` archives (`Export Originals.zip`, `Optimized Files.zip`, `Compressed Files.zip`) in the main output folder. This streamlines the process of preparing files for client delivery via download links, file transfer services, or physical media. This feature can be easily enabled or disabled via GUI/CLI.

*   **‚ö° Efficient Multi-Core Processing (CLI):**
    Leverages the power of multi-core CPUs for parallel image processing when using the Command-Line Interface (configurable via the `--workers N` argument). This can significantly speed up the processing of large photo shoots, saving valuable time. The GUI mode defaults to stable single-threaded processing for a responsive user experience.

*   **üîî Desktop Notifications (Optional):**
    Attempts to provide native OS notifications upon job completion or failure, keeping you informed of the status without needing to constantly monitor the application window (requires optional libraries/tools like `win10toast-reborn` on Windows or native macOS notification capabilities).

*   **üìù Comprehensive & Actionable Logging:**
    Generates a detailed `photopackager_run.log` file for each processing job. This log captures all operations, settings used, warnings, errors, and timing information, proving crucial for troubleshooting, record-keeping, and understanding processing details.

## üíæ Installation: Get Up & Running Smoothly

PhotoPackager is designed for easy setup on both Windows and macOS. We strongly recommend using our pre-built packaged applications for the simplest and quickest installation.

### Method 1: Installing the Packaged Application (Recommended for All Users)

No Python installation or technical expertise needed! Just download, install, and run.

#### ü™ü Windows Installation

Choose either the Installer or Portable version based on your preference:

1.  **Download:**
    *   **Installer:** `PhotoPackager_GUI_Installer.exe` from the [Official Releases Page](https://github.com/seagpt/PhotoPackager/releases/latest).
    *   **Portable:** `PhotoPackager_GUI_Portable.zip` from the [Official Releases Page](https://github.com/seagpt/PhotoPackager/releases/latest).
2.  **Run/Extract:**
    *   **Installer:** Double-click the downloaded `PhotoPackager_GUI_Installer.exe`.
        *   **Windows Defender SmartScreen:** You will likely see a "Windows protected your PC" prompt. This is standard for new applications from independent developers that haven't yet established a broad reputation with Microsoft.
            1.  Click "**More info**".
            2.  Verify the app name ("PhotoPackager GUI").
            3.  Click "**Run anyway**".
        *   Follow the on-screen installer prompts (e.g., accept license agreement, choose installation location, create shortcuts).
    *   **Portable:**
        1.  Right-click the downloaded `PhotoPackager_GUI_Portable.zip` and select "Extract All...".
        2.  Choose a folder on your computer where you want to place the application (e.g., `C:\Program Files\PhotoPackager` or `D:\PortableApps\PhotoPackager`).
        3.  Navigate into the extracted folder.
3.  **Launch:**
    *   **Installer:** Launch PhotoPackager from your Start Menu or the Desktop shortcut created by the installer.
    *   **Portable:** Double-click `PhotoPackager_GUI.exe` from within the folder where you extracted it. (The SmartScreen prompt might also appear on the first run of the portable executable; follow the same "More info" -> "Run anyway" steps).

#### üçé macOS Installation

1.  **Download:** Get the `PhotoPackager_GUI.dmg` file from the [Official Releases Page](https://github.com/seagpt/PhotoPackager/releases/latest).
2.  **Mount & Install:**
    *   Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file. This will mount a disk image and open a Finder window showing the `PhotoPackager_GUI.app`.
    *   Drag the `PhotoPackager_GUI.app` icon from this window into your main `/Applications` folder.
    *   You can now eject the "PhotoPackager" disk image from Finder (Ctrl-click or right-click on it and select "Eject").
3.  **First Launch (Important macOS Security Step):**
    *   Navigate to your `/Applications` folder.
    *   **Right-click** (or hold `Control` and click) on the `PhotoPackager_GUI.app` icon.
    *   Select "**Open**" from the contextual menu that appears.
    *   A dialog may appear warning that "macOS cannot verify the developer of this app. Are you sure you want to open it?" or similar wording about an "unidentified developer." This is because the app is not yet notarized through the Apple Developer Program.
    *   Click the "**Open**" button in this dialog.
    *   *Alternative for stubborn cases:* If the right-click method doesn't offer an "Open" option directly, or if it's still blocked, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**. Scroll down to the "Security" section. You should see a message near the bottom stating that "PhotoPackager_GUI.app was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer." Click the "**Open Anyway**" button next to this message. You might need to enter your Mac administrator password.
    *   This security override is typically only necessary for the very first time you launch the application. Subsequent launches can usually be done by simply double-clicking the app icon.

*(Optional First-Time Studio Setup): For persistent default studio branding (your company name, website, email for the client READMEs), you can edit the `config.py` file. This file is located near the `.exe` on Windows (in the installation or portable folder) or inside the `.app` bundle on macOS (Right-click `PhotoPackager_GUI.app` -> Show Package Contents -> Contents/Resources). Modifying this file sets the defaults that appear in the GUI, which you can still override per job.*

### Method 2: Running from Source (For Developers & Advanced Users)

If you're a developer, want to contribute, or prefer running from source:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.8 or newer installed.
    *   `pip` (Python package installer, usually comes with Python).
    *   `Git` (for cloning the repository).
2.  **Get the Code:** Clone the repository from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seagpt/PhotoPackager.git
    cd PhotoPackager
    ```
3.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):** In the project root (`PhotoPackager` directory), create and activate a virtual environment:
    *   Create: `python -m venv venv`
    *   Activate:
        *   Windows (Command Prompt): `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
        *   Windows (PowerShell): `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (If blocked, try `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process` in that PowerShell window first).
        *   macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh): `source venv/bin/activate`
    Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with `(venv)`, indicating the virtual environment is active.
4.  **Install Dependencies:** With the virtual environment active, install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Install any optional dependencies if you need their specific features:
    ```bash
    # For partial EXIF stripping options (Date Only, Camera Only, Date & Camera):
    pip install piexif
    # For non-blocking (toast) notifications on Windows:
    pip install win10toast-reborn
    ```
5.  **Configure (Optional but Recommended):** Edit the `config.py` file in the project root to customize default settings (studio branding, processing parameters, default folder names, etc.).
6.  **Run the GUI Application:** Ensure the `venv` is active and execute:
    ```bash
    python gui/main_window.py
    ```
7.  **Run the CLI (Command-Line Interface):** Ensure the `venv` is active. Use the following format:
    ```bash
    python main.py --source /path/to/your/shoot/images --output /path/to/deliveries_parent_folder [options...]
    ```
    For a full list of CLI options and their descriptions, run: `python main.py --help`.

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage: GUI Walkthrough ‚Äì Effortless Photo Packaging

The PhotoPackager Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed for an intuitive and straightforward user experience, even with its powerful underlying capabilities.

1.  **Launch Application:** Start PhotoPackager from your Applications folder (macOS) or Start Menu/Desktop (Windows).
2.  **üìÅ Step 1: Select Source Images Folder:**
    *   Click the first **"Browse..."** button, located next to the "Source Images Folder" label.
    *   A system file dialog will open. Navigate to and select the single main folder that contains all the original images for the *one specific shoot* you want to process.
    *   **Purpose:** This folder is the root from which PhotoPackager will read all your image files.
3.  **üìÇ Step 2: Select Output Parent Folder:**
    *   Click the second **"Browse..."** button, next to the "Output Parent Folder" label.
    *   Choose the main directory on your computer where you want PhotoPackager to create a *new, uniquely named subfolder* for this specific shoot's final packaged output.
    *   **Purpose:** This is the destination for all processed files and organizational structures for this job. PhotoPackager will create a subfolder here named after your "Shoot Base Name".
4.  **üè∑Ô∏è Step 3: Enter Shoot Base Name:**
    *   In the "Shoot Base Name" text field, type a descriptive and unique name for this specific shoot.
    *   Examples: `Johnson_Family_Fall_Portraits_2025`, `AcmeCorp_Product_Launch_Event_May2025`, `Wildlife_Safari_Kenya_Day03`.
    *   **Purpose:** This name is crucial. It will be used:
        *   As the name of the main output folder created within your "Output Parent Folder".
        *   As the prefix for all sequentially renamed image files (e.g., `001-Johnson_Family_Fall_Portraits_2025.jpg`).
        *   Using clear, descriptive names helps you and your clients easily identify shoots. Avoid special characters that might be problematic in file/folder names (stick to letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens).
5.  **üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Configure Processing Options (Main Settings Panel):**
    This is where you define *how* your images will be processed.
    *   **Originals Handling:** From the dropdown menu, choose how PhotoPackager should manage your original source files.
        *   `Copy` (Default & Safest): Duplicates originals into `Export Originals`. Your source files remain untouched.
        *   `Move` (**HIGH RISK!**): Moves originals. **Ensure backups exist before using!**
        *   `Leave`: Originals are left in their source location.
        *   `Skip Export`: Originals are ignored completely.
    *   **EXIF Policy:** From the dropdown, select how EXIF metadata should be handled for *generated* images (Optimized, Compressed).
        *   `Keep` (Default): Retains all metadata.
        *   `Strip All`: Removes all metadata.
        *   Specific options like `Date Only`, `Camera Only` (may require `piexif`).
    *   **Output Formats (Optimized Files & Compressed Files sections):**
        *   For "Optimized Files": Check ‚úÖ `Generate JPGs` and/or ‚úÖ `Generate WebPs` based on your needs for high-quality digital deliverables.
        *   For "Compressed Files": Check ‚úÖ `Generate JPGs` and/or ‚úÖ `Generate WebPs` if you need smaller, web-friendly previews or attachments.
    *   **Processing Controls:**
        *   ‚úÖ `Skip Compressed Versions`: If checked, PhotoPackager will *not* generate the "Compressed Files" category. Uncheck this if you need those smaller previews.
        *   ‚úÖ `Create ZIP Archives`: If checked, PhotoPackager will automatically create `.zip` files for each main output category (`Export Originals.zip`, `Optimized Files.zip`, `Compressed Files.zip`) in the final output folder, ready for easy delivery.
    *   **üß† Dry Run Mode (VERY IMPORTANT for testing):**
        *   ‚úÖ `Perform Dry Run (Simulate, No Changes)`: **It is STRONGLY recommended to check this box** for your first few runs with PhotoPackager, when testing new configurations, or before processing irreplaceable client work.
        *   A dry run simulates the entire process ‚Äì scanning, renaming, "processing" (without actual image manipulation), and "packaging" ‚Äì and logs everything it *would* have done in the Log Area and `photopackager_run.log`. **No actual files will be created, moved, or deleted on your system during a dry run.** Review the log output carefully to ensure the settings and planned actions are exactly what you intend before running a live job.
6.  **üè¢ Step 5: Set Delivery Branding (Client README Panel):**
    Customize the information that will appear in the `README.txt` file included in your client's delivery package.
    *   **Your Company Name:** Enter the name of your photography studio or business.
    *   **Your Website:** Enter your primary website URL (e.g., `https://www.yourstudioname.com`).
    *   **Your Support Email:** Enter the email address clients should use for inquiries.
    *   These fields will pre-fill with the defaults from your `config.py` file (if configured), but you can easily override them here for specific jobs or clients. This ensures the `README.txt` reflects *your* brand.
7.  **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 6: Start Processing:**
    *   Once you have reviewed all settings and are confident (especially if you've done a Dry Run), click the prominent **"Start Processing"** button.
8.  **üìä Step 7: Monitor Progress:**
    The application provides real-time feedback:
    *   **Status Label (Bottom Left):** Will update from "Idle" to "Validating Inputs...", "Processing Images (X of Y)...", "Creating ZIP Archives...", and finally to "Done! Processing complete." or "Error! See log for details." if an issue occurs.
    *   **Progress Bar (Bottom Center):** Provides a visual indication of the overall job completion percentage.
    *   **Log Area (Main Window):** This scrollable text box displays detailed, real-time messages about each step of the process, including files being processed, warnings encountered, and any errors. This is invaluable for understanding what the application is doing and for diagnosing issues.
9.  **üèÅ Step 8: Review Results:**
    *   Once the status label shows "Done! Processing complete.", navigate to your chosen "Output Parent Folder" using your system's file explorer (Finder on macOS, File Explorer on Windows).
    *   Inside, you will find a new folder named after the "Shoot Base Name" you provided. This folder contains the neatly organized output:
        *   `Export Originals` (if not skipped)
        *   `Optimized Files` (with `Optimized JPGs` and/or `Optimized WebPs` subfolders)
        *   `Compressed Files` (with `Compressed JPGs` and/or `Compressed WebPs` subfolders, if not skipped)
        *   The client-facing `README.txt` with your branding.
        *   A detailed `photopackager_run.log` for your records (and for troubleshooting).
        *   The `.zip` archives (e.g., `Optimized Files.zip`), if that option was enabled.
    *   Inspect the contents to ensure everything is as expected.

```

**Required Arguments:**

*   `--source SOURCE_PATH`, `-s SOURCE_PATH`
    *(Required)* Path to the folder containing the source images for the shoot.
    Example: `--source "/Users/YourName/Pictures/Shoots/Client_A_Wedding_Raw"`
*   `--output OUTPUT_PARENT_PATH`, `-o OUTPUT_PARENT_PATH`
    *(Required)* Path to the parent directory where the final shoot-specific output folder (named by `--base-name`) will be created.
    Example: `--output "/Users/YourName/Deliveries/Client_A"`

**Key Options & Arguments:**

*   `--base-name SHOOT_BASE_NAME`, `-bn SHOOT_BASE_NAME`
    Sets the descriptive name for the main output folder and the prefix for all renamed files. If omitted, defaults to the name of the source folder.
    Example: `--base-name "ClientA_Wedding_Final_Package_2025"`
*   `--originals-action {copy,move,leave,skip_export}`, `-oa {copy,move,leave,skip_export}`
    Determines how original source files are handled. (Default: `copy` from `config.py`)
    **WARNING: `--originals-action move` is destructive! Ensure backups exist.**
*   `--exif-policy {keep,strip_all,date,camera,both}`, `-ep {keep,strip_all,date,camera,both}`
    Specifies EXIF metadata handling for *generated* images. (Default: `keep` from `config.py`)
*   `--no-jpgs-optimized` / `--no-webp-optimized`
    Disables JPG/WebP generation respectively for Optimized files. (By default, both are often enabled via `config.py`)
*   `--create-jpgs-optimized` / `--create-webp-optimized`
    Explicitly enables JPG/WebP generation for Optimized files (overrides `config.py` if it disables them by default).
*   `--no-jpgs-compressed` / `--no-webp-compressed`
    Disables JPG/WebP generation respectively for Compressed files.
*   `--create-jpgs-compressed` / `--create-webp-compressed`
    Explicitly enables JPG/WebP generation for Compressed files.
*   `--skip-compressed-versions`, `-scv`
    If set, skips the generation of all "Compressed" image versions entirely.
*   `--no-skip-compressed-versions`
    Explicitly ensures compressed versions are generated (overrides `config.py` if it skips them by default).
*   `--create-zip-archives`, `-cza`
    Forces creation of `.zip` archives for output categories. (Default behavior set in `config.py`).
*   `--no-zip-archives`, `-nza`
    Explicitly disables the creation of all `.zip` archives.
*   `--workers N`, `-w N`
    Number of parallel worker processes for image processing tasks. (Default: System CPU count, configurable in `config.py`). Use `--workers 1` for sequential (single-threaded) processing if desired for stability or resource constraint reasons.
*   `--dry-run`, `-dr`
    **Crucial for testing!** Simulates the entire processing workflow without actually modifying, creating, or moving any files. Outputs a detailed log of what *would* have happened. **Highly recommended for testing ALL CLI commands and configurations before live runs.**
*   `--verbose`, `-v`
    Increases the verbosity of log output to the console and the `photopackager_run.log` file, providing more detailed step-by-step information during processing. Useful for debugging.

**Delivery Branding Arguments (for customizing the client-facing `README.txt`):**
*   `--delivery-company "Your Photography Studio Name"`
*   `--delivery-website "https://www.yourphotographystudio.com"`
*   `--delivery-email "clientsupport@yourphotographystudio.com"`
    (These override defaults set in `config.py` for this specific CLI job).

**Getting Comprehensive Help:**
To display the full list of all available CLI arguments, their detailed descriptions, current default values (as per `config.py`), and argument types, run:
```bash
python main.py --help
```
or
```bash
python main.py -h
```

**Example CLI Usage Scenarios:**

1.  **Critical Test: Dry Run Simulation with Verbose Output:**
    Before any live processing, always test your command with `--dry-run`.
    ```bash
    python main.py \
      --source "./MyPhotos/Johnson_Family_Shoot_RAWs" \
      --output "./Client_Deliveries/Johnson_Family" \
      --base-name "Johnson_Family_Portraits_Autumn2025_Package" \
      --originals-action copy \
      --create-webp-optimized \
      --skip-compressed-versions \
      --create-zip-archives \
      --delivery-company "My Awesome Photography" \
      --delivery-website "https://myawesomephotography.example.com" \
      --delivery-email "hello@myawesomephotography.example.com" \
      --dry-run \
      --verbose
    ```
    *Review the console output and the generated `photopackager_run.log` (which will be in the target output folder, even on dry run) to ensure everything is planned as expected.*

2.  **Standard Processing Job: Copy originals, create Optimized JPGs & WebPs, Compressed JPGs only, create ZIPs, use 4 worker processes:**
    (Remove `--dry-run` from the command above after successful testing).
    ```bash
    python main.py \
      --source "/mnt/photography_storage/Active_Shoots/Smith_Corporate_Event_June2025" \
      --output "/mnt/photography_storage/Final_Deliveries/Smith_Corp" \
      --base-name "Smith_Corp_Event_Photos_June2025" \
      --originals-action copy \
      --create-jpgs-optimized --create-webp-optimized \
      --create-jpgs-compressed --no-webp-compressed \
      --create-zip-archives \
      --workers 4 \
      --verbose
    ```

3.  **High-Risk Operation Example: MOVE originals, strip ALL EXIF from generated images, no ZIP archives, skip compressed versions.**
    **üõë WARNING: The `--originals-action move` flag IS DESTRUCTIVE. It will PERMANENTLY move files from your source location. ENSURE YOU HAVE RELIABLE, VERIFIED, AND INDEPENDENT BACKUPS *BEFORE* RUNNING ANY COMMAND WITH `--originals-action move`! Test thoroughly with `--dry-run` first on non-critical data.**
    ```bash
    # ENSURE BACKUPS ARE VERIFIED BEFORE RUNNING A COMMAND LIKE THIS!
    python main.py \
      --source "D:\Temp_Shoots\Highly_Confidential_Project_Source" \
      --output "E:\Secure_Archive\Client_XYZ_Deliverables" \
      --base-name "Project_Alpha_Redacted_Delivery" \
      --originals-action move \
      --exif-policy strip_all \
      --skip-compressed-versions \
      --no-zip-archives \
      --delivery-company "Secure Deliveries Inc." \
      --delivery-website "https://secure.example.com" \
      --delivery-email "contact@secure.example.com" \
      --workers 2 \
      --verbose
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Advanced Branding: Tailor PhotoPackager to Your Studio

PhotoPackager offers robust configuration options, allowing you to set persistent defaults and fine-tune its behavior to perfectly match your studio's unique workflow and branding requirements.

### The Heart of Configuration: `config.py`

Located in the project's root directory (when running from source) or within the application bundle/installation folder (for packaged versions), the `config.py` file is your central hub for establishing **application-wide defaults** and core **developer/studio identity**. It's highly recommended to review and edit this file *before* your first significant use of PhotoPackager, or any time you wish to change your standard operational procedures.

Key configurable sections within `config.py`:

*   **`USER_...` Variables (Your Studio's Default Identity):**
    *   `USER_COMPANY_NAME = "Your Photography Studio"`: Set your official studio or company name. This populates the default "Company Name" in the GUI and CLI for client `README.txt` branding.
    *   `USER_WEBSITE = "https://www.yourwebsite.com"`: Your primary website URL.
    *   `USER_SUPPORT_EMAIL = "support@yourwebsite.com"`: Your main support or client contact email address.
*   **`DEFAULT_...` Variables (Operational Defaults for GUI & CLI):**
    These control the pre-selected options in the GUI and the default behavior in the CLI if specific flags are omitted. Modify these to match your most common workflow, saving you clicks and keystrokes. Examples:
    *   `DEFAULT_ORIGINALS_ACTION = "copy"` (Options: "copy", "move", "leave", "skip_export")
    *   `DEFAULT_EXIF_POLICY = "keep"` (Options: "keep", "strip_all", "date", "camera", "both")
    *   `DEFAULT_CREATE_JPGS_OPTIMIZED = True` / `DEFAULT_CREATE_WEBP_OPTIMIZED = True`
    *   `DEFAULT_CREATE_JPGS_COMPRESSED = True` / `DEFAULT_CREATE_WEBP_COMPRESSED = True`
    *   `DEFAULT_SKIP_COMPRESSED_VERSIONS = False`
    *   `DEFAULT_CREATE_ZIP_ARCHIVES = True`
    *   `DEFAULT_CLI_WORKERS = 0` (0 means use system CPU count; set to a specific number like 1, 2, 4, etc.)
*   **Image Processing Parameters (Fine-tuning Quality & Size):**
    *   `OPTIMIZED_JPG_QUALITY = 90` (0-100, higher is better quality, larger file)
    *   `OPTIMIZED_WEBP_QUALITY = 85` (0-100 for lossy WebP, higher is better quality, larger file)
    *   `OPTIMIZED_WEBP_METHOD = 4` (0-6 for WebP, higher is slower encoding but better compression/quality)
    *   `COMPRESSED_TARGET_PIXELS = 2_000_000` (Target total megapixels for compressed images, e.g., approx 1920x1080. Images are resized proportionally to not exceed this pixel count).
    *   `COMPRESSED_JPG_QUALITY = 75`
    *   `COMPRESSED_WEBP_QUALITY = 70`
    *   `COMPRESSED_FALLBACK_QUALITY = 65` (Minimum quality for compressed JPEGs if adaptive quality struggles).
*   **Folder Names (`FOLDER_NAMES` Dictionary):**
    This dictionary allows you to customize the names of the output subdirectories created by PhotoPackager. For instance, you could change `"Optimized Files"` to `"High-Res_Client_JPGs"` or `"Export Originals"` to `"Full_Resolution_Masters_DNG"`.
    ```python
    FOLDER_NAMES = {
        "originals": "Export Originals",
        "optimized_parent": "Optimized Files",
        "optimized_jpg": "Optimized JPGs",
        # ... and so on for all output folders
    }
    ```
    **Caution:** Modifying these names should be done thoughtfully. While PhotoPackager will adapt internally, ensure your workflow, any downstream scripts, or client communication also recognize and align with these new names.
*   **UI & Logging Customization:**
    *   `ANSI_COLORS`: (Primarily for CLI) Customize console output colors for better readability or branding in terminal environments.
    *   Other UI-related defaults might be present depending on the PhotoPackager version.

### Per-Job Delivery Branding Overrides (GUI / CLI)

While `config.py` sets your *default* studio branding, PhotoPackager offers the flexibility to override this on a **per-job basis**. As detailed in the "Usage" sections:
*   **GUI:** The "Delivery Branding" panel allows you to enter a specific `Company Name`, `Website`, and `Support Email` for the current job.
*   **CLI:** The `--delivery-company`, `--delivery-website`, and `--delivery-email` arguments serve the same purpose for command-line operations.

This per-job branding information will be used to populate the client-facing `README.txt` file included in that specific delivery package, taking precedence over the global defaults from `config.py` for that particular run. This is ideal for studios managing multiple brands, catering to specific client requests, or white-labeling deliveries.

### Mandatory Attribution Notice ‚Äì A Note on Open Source

PhotoPackager is released under the permissive MIT License. We believe in open source and sharing! The license requires that the original developer attribution (Steven Seagondollar, DropShock Digital LLC) remains in the footer of the generated client-facing `README.txt` files and within the internal `photopackager_run.log` files.

Your custom Delivery Branding information (as set in `config.py` or per-job) is featured prominently in the main body of the client `README.txt`, ensuring *your* brand is front-and-center for your clients, while respecting the open-source origins of the tool.

## ‚ùó Warnings & Important Considerations: Use PhotoPackager Safely & Effectively

Please read these notes carefully to ensure a smooth, safe, and effective experience with PhotoPackager. Understanding these points can prevent data loss and frustration.

*   **üõë `MOVE` ORIGINALS OPTION: PERMANENT & DESTRUCTIVE ‚Äì EXTREME CAUTION ADVISED!**
    The "Move Originals" option (in the GUI) or the `--originals-action move` flag (in the CLI) will **PERMANENTLY DELETE** image files from their original source location after they are successfully moved to the output directory's `Export Originals` folder.
    *   **THERE IS NO UNDO FEATURE FOR THIS OPERATION WITHIN PHOTOPACKAGER.**
    *   **BEFORE EVER USING THE `move` OPTION:**
        1.  **Verify you have RELIABLE, INDEPENDENT, and RECENTLY TESTED backups of ALL your source images.** Multiple backup locations are strongly recommended.
        2.  Understand that if the process is interrupted or fails *after* some files have been moved but *before* all are processed, your files could be in a split state.
        3.  **Always perform a `--dry-run` (CLI) or check "Perform Dry Run" (GUI) multiple times on non-critical data to fully understand what will happen before using `move` on valuable images.**
    *   **DropShock Digital LLC and its developers are NOT liable for any data loss resulting from the use or misuse of this feature.** You use the `move` option entirely at your own risk. The `copy` option is the strongly recommended default for safety.

*   **üß™ ALWAYS USE `Dry Run` FOR TESTING CONFIGURATIONS:**
    Before processing critical client jobs, especially when:
    *   Trying new settings or features for the first time.
    *   Considering the `move` originals action.
    *   Using unfamiliar CLI commands or configurations.
    *   Processing an unusually large or complex shoot.
    **Do this:**
    *   **GUI:** Check the "Perform Dry Run (Simulate, No Changes)" box.
    *   **CLI:** Include the `--dry-run` flag in your command.
    A dry run simulates all actions (scanning, "renaming", "processing", "packaging") and generates a detailed log (`photopackager_run.log` and console output) of what *would* have occurred, without making any actual changes to your files. **Carefully review this log** to confirm the intended operations, file counts, and paths before proceeding with a live, non-dry run.

*   **üíæ Significant Disk Space Requirements:**
    PhotoPackager can generate multiple versions of your images (Originals, Optimized JPGs, Optimized WebPs, Compressed JPGs, Compressed WebPs) and, optionally, create ZIP archives for each category. This means the final output package can consume considerable disk space ‚Äì potentially **2 to 5 times the size of your original shoot folder**, depending on the selected options.
    *   **Ensure you have adequate free disk space on your designated output drive *before* starting a large processing job.** Insufficient space can lead to errors and incomplete processing.

*   **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Drive Syncing & Potential Conflicts:**
    Processing shoots directly from folders that are actively being synced by cloud storage services (e.g., OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud Drive, Box) can sometimes lead to issues:
    *   **File Access Conflicts:** The cloud service might try to sync a file (upload or download changes) while PhotoPackager is actively reading, writing, or moving it, leading to "file in use" errors, permission issues, or corrupted outputs.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Simultaneous syncing can consume network bandwidth and system resources, slowing down PhotoPackager's processing.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Syncing of partially written files or temporary files could cause confusion or errors.
    *   **Recommendation:** For the best and most reliable results:
        1.  **Pause cloud sync services** for the source and output directories during PhotoPackager processing.
        2.  Or, **work with local copies** of your shoot files that are *not* located in actively synced cloud folders. Sync the final output package *after* PhotoPackager has completed its job.

*   **‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements & Performance:**
    *   **Operating System:** Windows 10/11 (64-bit strongly recommended) or macOS (typically Big Sur 11.0+ recommended; check specific release notes for version compatibility).
    *   **Python (if running from source):** Python 3.8 or newer.
    *   **Key Libraries:** `Pillow` (for image processing), `PySide6` (for GUI). See `requirements.txt` for a full list.
    *   **CPU & RAM:** While PhotoPackager is designed to be efficient, processing very large images or huge batches of images will benefit from a faster CPU and more RAM (8GB+ recommended, 16GB+ for very heavy use). The CLI's multi-core processing (`--workers`) can significantly improve speed on capable machines.
    *   **Hard Drive Speed:** Using SSDs (Solid State Drives) for both source images and the output directory will noticeably improve performance compared to traditional HDDs, especially for I/O-intensive operations like copying and writing many files.

*   **üñºÔ∏è WebP EXIF Metadata Nuances:**
    While `Pillow` (the image processing library used) aims to preserve EXIF data during conversion, its support for embedding *all* original EXIF data types and tags into WebP files can sometimes be less comprehensive or behave differently compared to JPEGs. If retaining very specific, obscure, or all EXIF tags perfectly in WebP output is absolutely critical for your workflow, please conduct thorough tests with your specific image types and metadata requirements to verify.

*   **üö´ Corrupted or Unsupported Source Files:**
    PhotoPackager attempts to handle common image file issues gracefully. It will typically try to:
    *   Identify and skip corrupted or unreadable image files.
    *   Log a warning when a file is skipped due to being unreadable or of an unsupported format (it primarily focuses on common still image formats like JPG, PNG, TIFF, HEIC, and RAW formats that Pillow can decode).
    *   However, severely damaged files or exotic/proprietary image formats not supported by the underlying `Pillow` library could potentially cause unexpected behavior, errors, or even crashes in rare cases. It's always good practice to ensure your source images are generally sound and in common formats.

*   **‚öñÔ∏è "AS IS" Software Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability:**
    PhotoPackager is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders (Steven Seagondollar, DropShock Digital LLC) be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. This includes, but is not limited to, data loss.
    Please see the full [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file (MIT License) accompanying this software for the complete text, which includes a comprehensive disclaimer and limitation of liability. **Use PhotoPackager at your own risk, and always prioritize data backup strategies.**

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting / Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

If you encounter issues while using PhotoPackager, this section provides solutions to common problems. For more detailed diagnostics, always check the `photopackager_run.log` file generated in the output folder for the specific job that had issues.

1.  **Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PySide6'` (or `'PIL'`, `'joblib'`, `'piexif'`, etc.) when trying to run from source.**
    *   **Cause:** The necessary Python dependencies for PhotoPackager are not installed in your current Python environment, or your Python virtual environment (`venv`) is not active.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  Ensure you are in the PhotoPackager project's root directory in your terminal/command prompt.
        2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
            *   macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh): `source venv/bin/activate`
            *   Windows (Command Prompt): `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
            *   Windows (PowerShell): `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
        3.  Verify that `(venv)` appears at the beginning of your terminal prompt.
        4.  Re-install or install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If the error mentioned a specific optional library like `piexif`, install it explicitly: `pip install piexif`.
        5.  If you're trying to run `gui/main_window.py` directly and encounter `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'job'` (or similar for other custom modules within PhotoPackager), it might be an issue with Python's import path resolution. Ensure you are running scripts from the project root or that the project structure and `sys.path` modifications (if any, within the scripts) are set up correctly to allow modules to find each other.

2.  **Error: "Permission Denied", "Access Denied", or "OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied" during file operations (reading source, writing output, creating folders).**
    *   **Cause:** Your current user account lacks the necessary read permissions for the selected source folder or write permissions for the chosen output parent directory (or its subdirectories). Active cloud sync services (OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) can sometimes temporarily lock files or folders, leading to permission-like errors. Antivirus software might also be overly aggressive and block PhotoPackager's file operations.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **Check Permissions:** Verify and, if necessary, adjust folder permissions using your operating system's tools (e.g., "Get Info" on macOS and check Sharing & Permissions; "Properties > Security" tab on Windows). Ensure your user account has "Read & Write" or "Full Control".
        *   **Test with Simple Paths:** Try running a small test job with the output directed to a simple, known-writable local folder (e.g., `C:\Temp\PP_TestOutput` on Windows or `~/Desktop/PP_TestOutput` on macOS). This helps rule out issues with complex network paths, special characters in paths, or cloud-synced locations.
        *   **Cloud Sync:** Temporarily pause any cloud synchronization services that might be monitoring your source or output directories during processing.
        *   **Antivirus:** Temporarily disable your antivirus software or add PhotoPackager (and its installation folder) to its exclusion/whitelist. Remember to re-enable it afterward.
        *   **Avoid Running as Administrator/Root (unless absolutely necessary):** While it might seem like a quick fix, running applications with elevated privileges can sometimes create files with ownership/permissions that are problematic for your regular user account later. It's better to fix the underlying permission issue for your standard user.

3.  **GUI Launches, but clicking "Start Processing" does nothing, the application hangs (becomes unresponsive), or it crashes.**
    *   **Cause:** This can indicate several things: an unhandled error/exception in the backend processing logic, invalid or inaccessible input/output paths, a resource issue (e.g., out of memory when processing huge files, though less common for hangs), or a bug in the software. The GUI mode in PhotoPackager typically uses single-threading for image processing tasks to maintain UI stability; a hang usually means this main processing thread is blocked or has encountered a critical error.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  **Check the GUI Log Area:** Look immediately at the scrollable log area within the PhotoPackager window for any error messages, tracebacks, or clues that appeared right after you clicked "Start Processing".
        2.  **Examine `photopackager_run.log`:** This is crucial. Navigate to the output parent folder you specified. Even if the process fails early, PhotoPackager usually attempts to create a `photopackager_run.log` file (inside the shoot-specific subfolder it *would have* fully created). This log typically contains the most detailed error information, including a full Python traceback if an exception occurred.
        3.  **Validate Paths:** Double-check that your "Source Images Folder" and "Output Parent Folder" paths are absolutely correct, accessible, and that there are no typos or unusual characters.
        4.  **Simplify Test Case:** Try processing a *very small* set of known-good, common image files (e.g., 2-3 small JPEGs) into a new, simple output location with a very basic "Shoot Base Name". This can help isolate whether the issue is data-related, path-related, or a more general software bug.
        5.  **Check System Resources:** Ensure you have sufficient free disk space and RAM.

4.  **Output Folders (e.g., `Optimized Files`, `Compressed Files`, `Export Originals`) are empty or missing expected files after a run that reported "Done!".**
    *   **Cause:**
        *   **Dry Run Mode Was Active:** This is the most common reason. If "Perform Dry Run" was checked in the GUI or `--dry-run` was used in the CLI, no actual files would be written.
        *   **Incorrect Options Selected:** The relevant "Generate JPGs" / "Generate WebPs" options for Optimized or Compressed categories might have been unchecked. "Skip Compressed Versions" might have been checked if you were expecting compressed files. "Originals Handling" might have been set to "Skip Export" or "Leave".
        *   **No Matching Source Files:** If your source folder was empty or contained no image files that PhotoPackager could recognize or process, the output folders would naturally be empty.
        *   **Filtering Issues (less common):** If advanced file filtering options were somehow misconfigured (not a standard feature in basic PhotoPackager, but relevant if custom versions exist).
        *   **Permissions (again):** Write permission issues to the specific output subdirectories.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  **VERIFY DRY RUN IS OFF** for a live, productive run.
        2.  **Double-Check All Processing Options:** Carefully review every checkbox and dropdown in the GUI (or every flag in your CLI command) to ensure they align with your desired output.
        3.  **Inspect `photopackager_run.log`:** This log is your best friend. Look for:
            *   Messages indicating how many files were found in the source.
            *   Messages for each file stating whether it was "Successfully COPIED Original:", "Successfully SAVED Optimized JPG:", "Successfully SAVED Compressed WebP:", etc.
            *   If these success messages are missing for expected files, look for preceding error messages or skipping notifications related to those specific files (e.g., "Failed to process image:", "Skipping unreadable image:", "File does not match supported types:").
        4.  Ensure the final output directories (e.g., `.../ShootBaseName/Optimized Files/Optimized JPGs/`) are writable by your user account.

5.  **ZIP Files (`.zip`) are missing, empty, or incomplete after processing.**
    *   **Cause:**
        *   **"Create ZIP Archives" Option Disabled:** This checkbox (GUI) or flag (CLI) must be enabled.
        *   **Dry Run Mode Was Active:** ZIPs are not created during a dry run.
        *   **Content Folders Are Empty:** ZIP creation depends on the corresponding content folders (`Export Originals`, `Optimized Files`, `Compressed Files`) existing *and actually containing files*. If these folders are empty (due to other settings like skipping categories, or errors preventing file population), their respective ZIP archives might be skipped, be empty, or not created at all.
        *   **Insufficient Disk Space:** Creating ZIP archives, especially for large sets of images, can require significant temporary disk space (often in your system's temp directory) before the final ZIP is written to the output location.
        *   **Errors During ZIP Creation:** A specific error might have occurred during the zipping process itself (e.g., a file within a category was unreadable during zipping, though PhotoPackager usually processes them first).
        *   **Very Long File Paths:** Extremely long file paths *inside* the ZIP structure can sometimes cause issues with older unzipping utilities on some operating systems, though modern OS and tools handle this better.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  Ensure "Create ZIP Archives" is enabled and "Dry Run" is disabled.
        2.  **First, verify that the content folders** (`Export Originals`, `Optimized Files`, etc.) were correctly populated with the expected image files *before* checking the ZIPs. If the content folders are empty, address that issue first (see FAQ #4).
        3.  Check the `photopackager_run.log` for any specific errors logged during the "Creating ZIP archive for..." phases. It usually logs the start and successful completion (or failure) for each ZIP file it attempts to create.
        4.  Ensure ample free disk space on both your system drive (for temp files) and the output drive.

6.  **(Windows Specific) Desktop Notifications appear as standard pop-up message boxes, not as non-blocking "toast" notifications in the Action Center.**
    *   **Cause:** The optional `win10toast-reborn` Python library is not installed in the Python environment PhotoPackager is using (if running from source), or it might not have been successfully bundled with the packaged application, or Windows notification settings might be interfering.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **If running from source:** Ensure your virtual environment is active and install the library: `pip install win10toast-reborn`.
        *   **If using the packaged version:** This library should ideally be bundled. If toasts are not working, it might be a bundling issue with that specific release, or your Windows Focus Assist / Notification settings might be configured to suppress notifications from new apps. The standard message boxes are the default fallback and are still functional.

**For persistent, complex, or unlisted issues, please gather the following information *before* seeking support:**
*   Your **Operating System and its exact version** (e.g., Windows 11 Pro Version 23H2 OS Build 22631.xxxx, macOS Sonoma Version 14.3.1).
*   The **PhotoPackager version** you are using (this is often found in an "About" menu in the GUI, in the title of the release notes, or can be inferred from the download).
*   **Clear, step-by-step instructions** on how to reliably reproduce the issue.
*   The **full and complete content of the `photopackager_run.log` file** from the problematic job. Please copy-paste the entire text or attach the file.
*   **Screenshots** of the PhotoPackager GUI settings you used, or the exact CLI command you ran.
*   **Screenshots of any error messages** displayed on screen.
*   A brief description of the **expected behavior** versus the **actual behavior** you observed.
