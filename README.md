## üéØ Overview: Solving the Modern Photographer's Delivery Dilemma

**PhotoPackager** is a professional-grade desktop application meticulously engineered by **Steven Seagondollar** at **DropShock Digital LLC**. It's designed to automate and radically streamline the often complex, time-consuming, and error-prone post-production workflow for photographers, creative studios, marketing agencies, and anyone managing large volumes of digital images.

In today's high-resolution digital landscape, photographers capture stunning detail, resulting in original image files (RAWs or full-quality JPEGs) that can easily be 20MB, 50MB, or even 100MB+ *each*. While these pristine files are essential for archival, professional printing, and intensive re-editing, they present significant challenges when it comes to client delivery and everyday usability:

*   ü§Ø **Client Overwhelm & Storage Woes:** Most clients, whether large commercial entities or individual consumers, lack the robust local storage, high-speed internet, or technical expertise to comfortably handle hundreds or thousands of massive image files. Downloading, storing, and managing gigabytes (or terabytes!) of photos can quickly overwhelm their devices (smartphones, laptops), clog cloud storage, and lead to significant frustration.
*   üêå **Usability Barriers & Poor Experience:** Large files are slow to download, cumbersome to share on social media, often too large for standard email attachments, and can make website photo galleries sluggish, resulting in a subpar and often frustrating experience for the end-user who simply wants to enjoy and utilize their images effectively.
*   üß© **The Multi-Version Nightmare:** Different use cases demand different image specifications. A large-format print requires maximum resolution, a website needs lightweight and fast-loading images, social media platforms have their own optimization preferences and size constraints, and a quick client preview for selection needs to be easily accessible on any device. Manually creating, naming, and organizing all these variants for every single shoot is a monumental, repetitive, and creatively draining task.

**PhotoPackager is the elegant, automated solution to these critical pain points.** It empowers you to reclaim your time and deliver professional, client-friendly packages by:

1.  **üóÇÔ∏è Organizing Intelligently:** Automatically arranging entire photo shoots into a standardized, professional, and easily configurable folder structure, bringing consistent order to the chaos of post-production.
2.  **‚öôÔ∏è Processing with Unmatched Versatility:** Generating multiple, purpose-driven delivery formats from your source images in a single, automated pass:
    *   **Originals:** Safely copied or (with extreme caution) moved for archival, print, or master file retention.
    *   **Optimized Versions (JPG/WebP):** Beautifully balanced for exceptional visual fidelity at significantly reduced file sizes, perfect for high-quality digital delivery, client online galleries, and general professional use.
    *   **Compressed Versions (JPG/WebP):** Further resized and compressed for maximum portability and speed, ideal for web galleries requiring fast load times, email attachments, social media sharing, and quick client previews where file size is paramount.

## üöÄ User Experience & Reliability Enhancements

## üö¶ Launching PhotoPackager

To start the application, always use:

```bash
python app.py
```

- Do NOT run `main.py` or `gui/main_window.py` directly. These are internal modules and may not initialize the application correctly.
- The `app.py` entry point ensures proper setup for both CLI and GUI usage, and is the only officially supported launch method.

### Developer Notes
- The application previously had multiple entry points (`main.py`, `gui/main_window.py`). These are now deprecated for direct use.
- All packaging, .app creation, and CLI/GUI launches must use `app.py`.
- For CLI options, run:

```bash
python app.py cli --help
```

---

### Branding Defaults
On startup, PhotoPackager automatically populates delivery branding fields with DropShock Digital LLC information. You can customize these fields, and your changes will be saved as the new defaults only when you use the "Save as Defaults" button.

### User Guidance
All main input fields now include helpful placeholder text, making it easier to understand what information is required.

### Reliability & Testing
All core workflows are covered by automated tests. You can run tests with:
```bash
pytest --maxfail=3 --disable-warnings -v
```
3.  **üè∑Ô∏è Managing Metadata Consistently & Powerfully:** Ensuring EXIF metadata is handled intentionally and uniformly across all generated files ‚Äì whether preserving it fully, stripping it completely for privacy or size, or selectively retaining/removing specific tags like date or camera information.
4.  **üî¢ Renaming with Unparalleled Clarity:** Implementing consistent, sequential file renaming (e.g., `001-ShootBaseName.ext`, `002-ShootBaseName.ext`, etc.) for all output files, providing unparalleled clarity, effortless sorting, and a professional touch for client deliverables.
5.  **üéÅ Packaging with Your Professional Branding:** Assembling everything into polished, client-ready packages, complete with a customizable `README.txt` file prominently featuring *your* studio's name, website, and contact email, reinforcing your brand identity with every delivery.

PhotoPackager emphasizes **efficiency, reliability, operational safety, and producing outputs that reflect the high-quality standards synonymous with the DropShock Digital brand.** Configure it once via the central `config.py` file to match your studio's defaults, then process shoots quickly, consistently, and with confidence. Deliver results that not only showcase the premium quality of your photographic work but also provide your clients with conveniently sized, perfectly organized, and easily usable files, upholding the DropShock Digital standard of excellence and enhancing client satisfaction.

## ‚ú® Key Features: Your All-in-One Delivery Powerhouse

PhotoPackager comes loaded with features meticulously designed to conquer the challenges of the modern photographic workflow, saving you time and elevating your professional presentation:

*   **üñ•Ô∏è Intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
    A sleek, modern, and exceptionally easy-to-use desktop application built with **PySide6 (Qt 6.x)**. Allows for straightforward configuration of complex processing jobs and execution with just a few clicks. Ideal for daily studio use by photographers and editors of all technical skill levels, requiring a minimal learning curve.

*   **‚å®Ô∏è Powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
    A comprehensive non-interactive CLI (accessible via `app.py cli ...`) enabling advanced scripting, full automation of repetitive tasks, and batch processing. Ideal for power users, technical teams, and integration into larger automated workflows. All job settings are loaded from `config/config.json` and `config/user_config.json`, with `source` and `destination` paths provided as command-line arguments overriding any configured paths.
    Example usage:
    ```bash
    python app.py cli --source /path/to/your/photos --destination /path/to/output_folder
    ```
    For detailed CLI options for the `cli` subcommand itself:
    ```bash
    python app.py cli --help
    ```
*   **üìÇ Standardized & Highly Configurable Output Structure:**
    Automatically generates a consistent, professional, and client-friendly folder hierarchy for each processed shoot. The default structure typically includes: `Export Originals`, `Optimized Files/Optimized JPGs`, `Optimized Files/Optimized WebPs`, `Compressed Files/Compressed JPGs`, `Compressed Files/Compressed WebPs`. **All folder names are fully customizable** in the `config.py` file, allowing you to tailor the output structure to your studio's specific branding or organizational needs.

*   **üñºÔ∏è Multi-Format Image Generation Engine:**
    The core of PhotoPackager's power lies in its ability to create multiple, purpose-driven versions from your source files in a single operation:
    *   **Optimized Versions:** Produces high-quality JPEGs and/or WebPs, carefully balanced using configurable quality settings (e.g., quality 85-95 for JPEGs) to retain excellent visual detail while significantly reducing file sizes (often achieving 50-80% reduction compared to full-res originals). Perfect for primary digital delivery, online client galleries, and general professional use where quality is key but original file sizes are impractical.
    *   **Compressed Versions:** Generates further resized (to a configurable target pixel count, e.g., 2048px on the long edge, or a total megapixel target like 2MP) and compressed JPEGs and/or WebPs. These are ideal for web galleries requiring lightning-fast load times, email attachments, social media sharing, and quick client previews, often resulting in dramatic file size reductions (typically 90-98% smaller than originals).
    *   *Granular Control:* Easily toggle JPG and/or WebP generation for each category (Optimized, Compressed). Choose to skip compressed versions entirely if not needed. All quality settings, resizing parameters (including target megapixels or long-edge pixels), and WebP compression effort levels are configurable via the GUI and `config.py`.

*   **üõ°Ô∏è Configurable & Safe Originals Handling:**
    Provides flexible and, above all, **safe** options for managing your precious source image files during processing:
    *   `Copy`: (Default & Safest) Safely duplicates your original files into the `Export Originals` folder. Your source files remain untouched.
    *   `Move`: (**HIGH RISK!**) Permanently moves original files from source to output. **Ensure you have verified backups before using this option!**
    *   `Leave`: Originals are left untouched in their source location; no copies are made to the output package.
    *   `Skip Export`: Originals are ignored completely for this processing job; no `Export Originals` folder will be created.
    *   **EXTREME CAUTION:** The `Move` option is a destructive operation. It will PERMANENTLY delete files from their original location. Ensure you have reliable, verified, and independent backups *before* using this option. Test thoroughly with `--dry-run` first on non-critical data.

*   **üè∑Ô∏è Granular EXIF Metadata Control:**
    Offers precise, configurable control over how EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) metadata is handled in the *generated* (Optimized and Compressed) images:
    *   `Keep`: (Default) Retains all original EXIF metadata from the source file in the processed versions.
    *   `Strip All`: Removes all EXIF data entirely from the generated images. Useful for maximizing client privacy, reducing final file sizes, or removing sensitive GPS or camera setting information.
    *   `Date Only`: Selectively removes only date and time related EXIF tags (requires the optional `piexif` library).
    *   `Camera Only`: Selectively removes only camera make/model and lens information related EXIF tags (requires optional `piexif` library).
    *   `Date & Camera`: Removes both date/time and camera/lens related EXIF tags (requires optional `piexif` library).

*   **üî¢ Consistent Sequential File Renaming:**
    Systematically renames all output files (Optimized, Compressed, and any copied/moved Originals) to a clear, consistent, and sortable `###-<ShootBaseName>.ext` format (e.g., `001-Johnson_Family_Portraits_2025.jpg`, `002-Johnson_Family_Portraits_2025.webp`). The `Shoot Base Name` is provided by you for each job, ensuring easy identification, professional presentation, and hassle-free sorting for both you and your clients.

*   **üè¢ Customizable Delivery Branding for *Your* Studio:**
    Empower your brand and provide a personalized touch with every client delivery:
    *   Set **your own** `Company Name`, `Website URL`, and `Support Email Address` via the GUI or CLI on a per-job basis.
    *   This information is automatically and prominently embedded in the client-facing `README.txt` file that is included in the final delivery package.
    *   This allows for highly personalized client deliveries that clearly feature *your* studio's brand, building recognition, trust, and professionalism. (Developer attribution respectfully remains in the footer of generated files as per the MIT license).

*   **üì¶ Automatic Multi-ZIP Archiving:**
    Optionally creates up to three distinct `.zip` archives (`Export Files.zip`, `Optimized Files.zip`, `Compressed Files.zip`) in the main output folder. This greatly streamlines the process of preparing files for client delivery via download links, file transfer services (like WeTransfer, Dropbox), or for providing organized archives on physical media. This feature can be easily enabled or disabled via the GUI or CLI.

*   **‚ö° Efficient Multi-Core Processing (CLI):**
    Leverages the power of modern multi-core CPUs for parallel image processing when using the Command-Line Interface (configurable via the `--workers N` argument, where N is the number of cores). This can significantly speed up the processing of large photo shoots, saving valuable time in your workflow. The GUI mode currently defaults to stable single-threaded processing for a consistently responsive user experience, with multi-threading for GUI planned for future enhancements.

*   **üîî Desktop Notifications (Optional):**
    Attempts to provide native OS desktop notifications upon job completion or encountering a critical error. This keeps you informed of the processing status without needing to constantly monitor the application window, allowing you to multitask more effectively (requires optional libraries/tools like `win10toast-reborn` on Windows or leverages native macOS notification capabilities).

*   **üìù Comprehensive & Actionable Logging:**
    Generates a detailed `photopackager_run.log` file within each job's output folder. This log captures all operations performed, the settings used for the job, processing times, any warnings encountered (e.g., skipped files), and critical error messages with tracebacks. This log is invaluable for troubleshooting issues, keeping a record of processing parameters, and understanding the details of each job run.

## üíæ Installation: Get Up & Running Smoothly

PhotoPackager is designed for easy setup on both Windows and macOS. We strongly recommend using our pre-built packaged applications for the simplest and quickest installation experience.

### Method 1: Installing the Packaged Application (Recommended for All Users)

No Python installation or technical command-line expertise needed! Just download, install (or extract), and run.

#### ü™ü Windows Installation

Choose either the Installer or Portable version based on your preference:

1.  **Download:**
    *   **Installer:** `PhotoPackager_GUI_Installer.exe` from the [Official Releases Page](https://github.com/seagpt/PhotoPackager/releases/latest). This version will guide you through a standard installation process and create shortcuts.
    *   **Portable:** `PhotoPackager_GUI_Portable.zip` from the [Official Releases Page](https://github.com/seagpt/PhotoPackager/releases/latest). This version can be run directly after extraction without installation, ideal for carrying on a USB drive or avoiding system-wide installs.
2.  **Run/Extract:**
    *   **Installer (`.exe`):**
        1.  Double-click the downloaded `PhotoPackager_GUI_Installer.exe`.
        2.  **Windows Defender SmartScreen:** You will likely see a "Windows protected your PC" prompt. This is a standard security measure for new applications from independent developers that haven't yet established a broad reputation with Microsoft.
            *   Click on the "**More info**" link within the SmartScreen dialog.
            *   Verify the app name (e.g., "PhotoPackager GUI").
            *   Click the "**Run anyway**" button.
        3.  Follow the on-screen instructions in the installer wizard (e.g., accept the license agreement, choose your preferred installation location, decide on shortcut creation).
    *   **Portable (`.zip`):**
        1.  Right-click the downloaded `PhotoPackager_GUI_Portable.zip` file and select "**Extract All...**" (or use your preferred unzipping utility like 7-Zip or WinRAR).
        2.  Choose a folder on your computer where you want to place the application files (e.g., `C:\Program Files\PhotoPackagerPortable` or `D:\PortableApps\PhotoPackager`).
        3.  Once extracted, navigate into the created folder.
3.  **Launch:**
    *   **Installer Version:** Launch PhotoPackager from your Windows Start Menu or the Desktop shortcut created by the installer.
    *   **Portable Version:** Double-click the `PhotoPackager_GUI.exe` (or simply `app.exe` if renamed in packaging) file from within the folder where you extracted the portable version. (The SmartScreen prompt might also appear on the first run of the portable executable; follow the same "More info" -> "Run anyway" steps if it does).

#### üçé macOS Installation

1.  **Download:** Get the `PhotoPackager_GUI.dmg` (Disk Image) file from the [Official Releases Page](https://github.com/seagpt/PhotoPackager/releases/latest).
2.  **Mount & Install:**
    *   Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file. This will mount a virtual disk image and typically open a Finder window showing its contents.
    *   Inside this Finder window, you will see the `PhotoPackager_GUI.app` icon (and often a shortcut to your Applications folder).
    *   Drag the `PhotoPackager_GUI.app` icon from this window and drop it into your main `/Applications` folder (usually found in the Finder sidebar or by going to "Go > Applications" in the menu bar).
    *   After copying, you can eject the mounted "PhotoPackager" disk image from Finder (e.g., by dragging its icon on your Desktop to the Trash/Eject icon, or Ctrl-clicking/right-clicking on it in the Finder sidebar and selecting "Eject").
3.  **First Launch (Important macOS Security Step):**
    Due to macOS's Gatekeeper security feature, you may need to perform an extra step the very first time you launch an application downloaded from the internet that isn't from the App Store or an Apple-notarized developer.
    *   Navigate to your `/Applications` folder in Finder.
    *   Locate `PhotoPackager_GUI.app`.
    *   **Right-click** (or hold the `Control` key and click) on the `PhotoPackager_GUI.app` icon.
    *   Select "**Open**" from the contextual menu that appears.
    *   A dialog box may appear with a warning such as "macOS cannot verify the developer of this app. Are you sure you want to open it?" or similar wording about an "unidentified developer." This is expected for non-notarized apps.
    *   Click the "**Open**" button in this dialog.
    *   *Alternative for more restrictive settings:* If the right-click "Open" method doesn't work or is not available, you might need to go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**. Scroll down to the "Security" section. You should see a message near the bottom stating that "PhotoPackager_GUI.app was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer." Click the "**Open Anyway**" button next to this message. You may be prompted to enter your Mac administrator password.
    *   This security override procedure is typically only necessary for the very *first* time you launch the application. Subsequent launches can usually be done by simply double-clicking the app icon in your Applications folder or from the Dock.

*(Optional First-Time Studio Setup for Packaged Apps): For persistent default studio branding (your company name, website, email for the client READMEs), you can often edit the `config.py` file. This file is typically located alongside the main executable in the installation or portable folder on Windows, or inside the `.app` bundle on macOS (Right-click `PhotoPackager_GUI.app` -> Show Package Contents -> Contents/Resources). Modifying this file sets the defaults that appear in the GUI, which you can still override on a per-job basis.)*

### Method 2: Running from Source (For Developers, Advanced Users & Contributors)

If you're a developer, wish to contribute to the PhotoPackager project, or prefer running applications directly from their source code:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Python:** Version **3.12.10** (or a compatible 3.12.x version) must be installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
        *   Ensure that `python3` (on macOS/Linux) or `python` (on Windows, if aliased correctly during Python installation) is accessible from your command line, and that `pip` (Python's package installer for Python 3.12) is also correctly installed and added to your system's PATH.
        *   **macOS Users:** You will typically use the `python3` command (e.g., `python3 --version`) and `pip3` (or preferably `python3 -m pip`) for Python 3.x operations to avoid conflicts with any older system Python 2.x.
    *   **Git:** Required for cloning the repository. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2.  **Get the Code:** Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the PhotoPackager repository from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seagpt/PhotoPackager.git
    cd PhotoPackager
    ```
3.  **Set Up a Python Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):**
    It's best practice to create an isolated Python environment for each project to manage dependencies without conflicts. Navigate to the cloned `PhotoPackager` root directory in your terminal and run:
    *   **For macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv_photopackager  # You can name 'venv_photopackager' as you like, e.g., 'venv_mac'
        source venv_photopackager/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **For Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv_photopackager
        venv_photopackager\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    *   **For Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv_photopackager
        .\venv_photopackager\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        # If PowerShell blocks script execution, you might need to run this command first in the same PowerShell window:
        # Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
        ```
    After successful activation, your terminal prompt should be prefixed with `(venv_photopackager)` (or your chosen venv name), indicating that the virtual environment is active.
4.  **Install Dependencies:** With the virtual environment active, install all the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
    *   **Universal Command (recommended for explicitness, especially on macOS/Linux):**
        ```bash
        python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   **Windows (if `python3` isn't directly mapped, and venv `python` is preferred):**
        ```bash
        python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        # Or simply: pip install -r requirements.txt (if pip is correctly pathed by the venv)
        ```
    Install any optional dependencies if you need their specific features (though most core features should rely on `requirements.txt`):
    ```bash
    # Example for piexif, if it's still managed as optional for specific EXIF policies:
    python3 -m pip install piexif
    # Example for Windows toast notifications:
    # python3 -m pip install win10toast-reborn
    ```
5.  **Configure (Optional but Recommended for Defaults):**
    Edit the `config.py` file located in the project root. This allows you to customize default settings such as your studio branding for the client README, default image processing parameters (quality, sizes), default folder names for output, etc.
6.  **Run the GUI Application from Source:**
    Ensure your virtual environment is active and you are in the project's root directory. The main entry point for the GUI application is `app.py`.
    ```bash
    # For macOS / Linux (or Windows if python3 is your command for Python 3.12)
    python3 app.py

    # For Windows (if python is your command for Python 3.12)
    # python app.py

    # To run with Qt debugging information enabled (useful for GUI development):
    # python3 app.py --debug_qt
    ```
7.  **Run the CLI (Command-Line Interface) from Source:**
    Ensure your virtual environment is active and you are in the project's root directory. The entry point for the CLI is `app.py cli ...`.
    ```bash
    # For macOS / Linux
    python3 app.py cli --source /path/to/your/shoot/images --output /path/to/deliveries_parent_folder [options...]

    # For Windows
    # python app.py cli --source C:\Path\To\Images --output D:\Path\To\Parent [options...]

    # To see all available CLI options and their descriptions:
    python3 app.py cli --help
    ```

---

2.  **üìÅ Step 1: Select Source Images Folder:**
    *   Click the first **"Browse..."** button, located next to the "Source Images Folder" label.
    *   A system file dialog will open. Navigate to and select the single main folder that contains all the original images for the *one specific shoot* you want to process.
    *   **Purpose:** This folder is the root from which PhotoPackager will read all your image files for the current job.
3.  **üìÇ Step 2: Select Output Parent Folder:**
    *   Click the second **"Browse..."** button, next to the "Output Parent Folder" label.
    *   Choose the main directory on your computer where you want PhotoPackager to create a *new, uniquely named subfolder* for this specific shoot's final packaged output.
    *   **Purpose:** This is the destination for all processed files and organizational structures for this job. PhotoPackager will create a subfolder here named after your "Shoot Base Name".
4.  **üè∑Ô∏è Step 3: Enter Shoot Base Name:**
    *   In the "Shoot Base Name" text field, type a descriptive and unique name for this specific shoot.
    *   Examples: `Johnson_Family_Fall_Portraits_2025`, `AcmeCorp_Product_Launch_Event_May2025`, `Wildlife_Safari_Kenya_Day03`.
    *   **Purpose:** This name is crucial. It will be used:
        *   As the name of the main output folder created within your "Output Parent Folder".
        *   As the prefix for all sequentially renamed image files (e.g., `001-Johnson_Family_Fall_Portraits_2025.jpg`).
        *   Using clear, descriptive names helps you and your clients easily identify shoots. It's best to stick to letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`) to avoid issues with file/folder naming across different operating systems.
5.  **üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Configure Processing Options (Main Settings Panel):**
    This is where you define *how* your images will be processed. Carefully review these options for each job.
    *   **Originals Handling:** From the dropdown menu, choose how PhotoPackager should manage your original source files.
        *   `Copy` (Default & Safest): Duplicates originals into the `Export Originals` folder. Your source files remain untouched.
        *   `Move` (**HIGH RISK!**): Moves originals from source to output. **Ensure you have verified backups before using this option!**
        *   `Leave`: Originals are left untouched in their source location; no copies are made to the output package.
        *   `Skip Export`: Originals are ignored completely for this processing job; no `Export Originals` folder will be created.
    *   **EXIF Policy:** From the dropdown, select how EXIF metadata should be handled for *generated* images (i.e., the Optimized and Compressed versions).
        *   `Keep` (Default): Retains all metadata from the original image.
        *   `Strip All`: Removes all EXIF metadata.
        *   Specific options like `Date Only`, `Camera Only`, `Date & Camera` (these may require the optional `piexif` library to be installed if running from source; packaged versions should include it if these options are enabled).
    *   **Output Formats (Separate sections for "Optimized Files" & "Compressed Files"):**
        *   For "Optimized Files": Check ‚úÖ `Generate JPGs` and/or ‚úÖ `Generate WebPs` based on your needs for high-quality digital deliverables. Uncheck if you don't need a particular format.
        *   For "Compressed Files": Check ‚úÖ `Generate JPGs` and/or ‚úÖ `Generate WebPs` if you need smaller, web-friendly previews or attachments. Uncheck if not needed.
    *   **Processing Controls:**
        *   ‚úÖ `Skip Compressed Versions`: If this box is checked, PhotoPackager will *not* generate the "Compressed Files" category at all. Uncheck this if you need those smaller, resized preview images.
        *   ‚úÖ `Create ZIP Archives`: If this box is checked, PhotoPackager will automatically create separate `.zip` files for each main output category (`Export Files.zip`, `Optimized Files.zip`, `Compressed Files.zip`) in the final output folder. This is very convenient for preparing files for client delivery.
    *   **üß† Dry Run Mode (VERY IMPORTANT for testing and safety):**
        *   ‚úÖ `Perform Dry Run (Simulate, No Changes)`: **It is STRONGLY recommended to check this box** for your first few runs with PhotoPackager, when testing new configurations or settings, or especially before processing irreplaceable client work or using the `Move` originals option.
        *   A dry run simulates the entire processing workflow ‚Äì scanning files, determining renaming, "processing" (without actual image manipulation or file writing), and "packaging" ‚Äì and logs everything it *would* have done in the Log Area within the GUI and in the `photopackager_run.log` file. **No actual files will be created, moved, or deleted on your system during a dry run.** Review the log output carefully to ensure the settings and planned actions are exactly what you intend before running a live, productive job.
6.  **üè¢ Step 5: Set Delivery Branding (Client README Customization Panel):**
    Customize the information that will appear in the `README.txt` file automatically included in your client's delivery package. This is your chance to reinforce your brand.
    *   **Your Company Name:** Enter the name of your photography studio, agency, or business.
    *   **Your Website:** Enter your primary website URL (e.g., `https://www.yourstudioname.com`). Make sure it's the full URL.
    *   **Your Support Email:** Enter the email address clients should use if they have questions or need support regarding their photos.
    *   These fields will pre-fill with the default values from your `config.py` file (if you've configured them there), but you can easily override them here for specific jobs or clients.
7.  **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 6: Start Processing:**
    *   Once you have carefully reviewed all your settings and are confident with your choices (especially if you've performed a successful Dry Run), click the prominent **"Start Processing"** button.
8.  **üìä Step 7: Monitor Progress:**
    The application provides real-time feedback during processing:
    *   **Status Label (Usually at the bottom or top of the window):** Will update dynamically, showing messages like "Idle", "Validating Inputs...", "Scanning Source Files...", "Processing Images (X of Y)...", "Creating Optimized JPGs...", "Creating ZIP Archives...", and finally "Done! Processing complete." or "Error! See log for details." if an issue occurs.
    *   **Progress Bar (Typically alongside the Status Label):** Provides a visual indication of the overall job completion percentage, giving you an idea of how much longer the process will take.
    *   **Log Area (Main scrollable text box in the GUI):** This is your window into what PhotoPackager is doing. It displays detailed, real-time messages about each step of the process, including files being scanned, images being processed, warnings encountered (e.g., "Skipping unsupported file..."), and any errors that occur. This log is invaluable for understanding the process and for diagnosing issues if they arise.
9.  **üèÅ Step 8: Review Your Professional Output:**
    *   Once the status label clearly indicates "Done! Processing complete.", navigate to your chosen "Output Parent Folder" using your system's file explorer (Finder on macOS, File Explorer on Windows).
    *   Inside this parent folder, you will find a new folder named exactly after the "Shoot Base Name" you provided in Step 3. This is your complete, packaged shoot.
    *   Open this shoot-specific folder. Inside, you'll find the neatly organized output structure:
        *   `Export Originals` folder (if this option was not skipped).
        *   `Optimized Files` folder (containing `Optimized JPGs` and/or `Optimized WebPs` subfolders, if generated).
        *   `Compressed Files` folder (containing `Compressed JPGs` and/or `Compressed WebPs` subfolders, if generated and not skipped).
        *   The client-facing `README.txt` file, personalized with your delivery branding.
        *   A detailed `photopackager_run.log` file for your records (and for troubleshooting if needed).
        *   The `.zip` archives (e.g., `Optimized Files.zip`, `Compressed Files.zip`), if you enabled that option.
    *   Thoroughly inspect the contents of these folders and the `README.txt` to ensure everything is as expected and meets your quality standards before delivering to your client.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage: CLI Reference ‚Äì Automation & Power User Control

For advanced users, scripting enthusiasts, and those looking to integrate PhotoPackager into automated workflows, the non-interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI) offers comprehensive control over all processing parameters.

**Accessing the CLI:**
Open your terminal (on macOS/Linux) or command prompt/PowerShell (on Windows). Navigate to the root directory of the PhotoPackager project. If you are running from source, ensure your Python virtual environment is activated.

**Basic Syntax:**
```bash
# On macOS/Linux (or Windows if python3 is your command for Python 3.12)
python3 app.py cli --source <path_to_source_images_folder> --output <path_to_output_parent_folder> [OPTIONS...]

# On Windows (if python is your command for Python 3.12)
# python app.py cli --source C:\Path\To\Images --output D:\Path\To\Parent [options...]
```

**Required Arguments:**

*   `--source SOURCE_PATH`, `-s SOURCE_PATH`
    *(Required)* Specifies the full path to the folder containing the source images for the shoot.
    Example: `--source "/Users/YourName/Pictures/Shoots/Client_A_Wedding_Raw"`
*   `--output OUTPUT_PARENT_PATH`, `-o OUTPUT_PARENT_PATH`
    *(Required)* Specifies the full path to the parent directory where the final shoot-specific output folder (which will be named according to the `--base-name` argument) will be created.
    Example: `--output "/Users/YourName/Client_Deliveries/Client_A_Output"`

**Key Options & Arguments (Refer to `python3 app.py cli --help` for the complete, most up-to-date list):**

*   `--base-name SHOOT_BASE_NAME`, `-bn SHOOT_BASE_NAME`
    Sets the descriptive name for the main output folder and serves as the prefix for all sequentially renamed files. If this argument is omitted, PhotoPackager typically defaults to using the name of the source folder.
    Example: `--base-name "ClientA_Wedding_Final_Package_2025"`
*   `--originals-action {copy,move,leave,skip_export}`, `-oa {copy,move,leave,skip_export}`
    Determines how original source files are handled. The default value is usually `copy` (as set in `config.py`).
    **üõë WARNING: `--originals-action move` is a destructive operation! It will PERMANENTLY move files from your source location. Ensure you have reliable, verified, and independent backups *before* using this option. Test thoroughly with `--dry-run` first on non-critical data.**
*   `--exif-policy {keep,strip_all,date,camera,both}`, `-ep {keep,strip_all,date,camera,both}`
    Specifies how EXIF metadata should be handled for *generated* images (Optimized and Compressed). The default is usually `keep` (from `config.py`).
*   Image Format Toggles (Examples - actual flags might vary slightly, check `--help`):
    *   `--no-jpgs-optimized` / `--no-webp-optimized`: Disables JPG/WebP generation respectively for Optimized files. (By default, both are often enabled via `config.py`).
    *   `--create-jpgs-optimized` / `--create-webp-optimized`: Explicitly enables JPG/WebP generation for Optimized files, overriding `config.py` if it disables them by default.
    *   Similar flags exist for `--jpgs-compressed` and `--webp-compressed`.
*   `--skip-compressed-versions`, `-scv`
    If this flag is present, PhotoPackager will skip the generation of all "Compressed" image versions entirely.
*   `--no-skip-compressed-versions`
    Use this flag to explicitly ensure compressed versions are generated, overriding a `config.py` setting that might skip them by default.
*   `--create-zip-archives`, `-cza`
    Forces the creation of `.zip` archives for the main output categories (`Export Originals`, `Optimized Files`, `Compressed Files`). The default behavior for ZIP creation is typically set in `config.py`.
*   `--no-zip-archives`, `-nza`
    Explicitly disables the creation of all `.zip` archives for this run, overriding `config.py`.
*   `--workers N`, `-w N`
    Specifies the number of parallel worker processes to use for image processing tasks. `N` should be an integer. Using `0` (often the default from `config.py`) typically means PhotoPackager will attempt to use all available system CPU cores. For sequential (single-threaded) processing (similar to current GUI behavior), use `--workers 1`. This can be useful for resource-constrained environments or for maximum stability during debugging.
*   `--dry-run`, `-dr`
    **This is a CRUCIAL flag for testing!** When `--dry-run` is used, PhotoPackager simulates the entire processing workflow (scanning, "renaming", "processing", "packaging") *without actually modifying, creating, or moving any files on your system*. It will output a detailed log to the console and to the `photopackager_run.log` file indicating what actions *would* have been taken. **It is highly recommended to use `--dry-run` to test ALL your CLI commands and configurations thoroughly, especially complex ones or those involving the `--originals-action move` flag, before executing them on live, valuable data.**
*   `--verbose`, `-v`
    Increases the verbosity level of log output, both to the console and to the `photopackager_run.log` file. This provides more detailed step-by-step information during processing and can be very helpful for debugging issues or understanding exactly what the application is doing at each stage.

**Delivery Branding Arguments (for customizing the client-facing `README.txt` via CLI):**
These arguments allow you to override the default branding settings from `config.py` for a specific CLI job.
*   `--delivery-company "Your Photography Studio Name"`
*   `--delivery-website "https://www.yourphotographystudio.com"`
*   `--delivery-email "clientsupport@yourphotographystudio.com"`

**Getting Comprehensive Help from the CLI:**
To display the full list of all available CLI arguments, their detailed descriptions, their current default values (which are influenced by your `config.py` settings), and the expected argument types, run:
```bash
python3 app.py cli --help
```
or
```bash
python3 app.py cli -h
```
Review this help output carefully to understand all available controls.

**Example CLI Usage Scenarios:**

1.  **Critical First Step: Thorough Dry Run Test with Verbose Output:**
    Before any live processing, *always* test your intended command with `--dry-run` and `--verbose`.
    ```bash
    python3 app.py cli \
      --source "./My_Photo_Shoots/Johnson_Family_Fall2025_RAWs" \
      --output "./Client_Deliveries_Output/Johnson_Family" \
      --base-name "Johnson_Family_Portraits_Autumn2025_FinalSelection" \
      --originals-action copy \
      --create-jpgs-optimized --create-webp-optimized \
      --create-jpgs-compressed --no-webp-compressed \
      --skip-compressed-versions \ # Example: Let's say we decided to skip compressed for this one
      --create-zip-archives \
      --workers 4 \
      --delivery-company "My Awesome Photography Studio" \
      --delivery-website "https://myawesomephotography.example.com" \
      --delivery-email "hello@myawesomephotography.example.com" \
      --dry-run \
      --verbose
    ```
    *After running this, carefully review the console output and the generated `photopackager_run.log` (which will be located in the target output folder, even on a dry run) to ensure all planned actions, file counts, paths, and renaming schemes are exactly as you expect.*

2.  **Standard Production Processing Job (after successful dry run):**
    To perform the actual processing, remove the `--dry-run` flag from the command you tested above.
    ```bash
    python3 app.py cli \
      --source "./My_Photo_Shoots/Johnson_Family_Fall2025_RAWs" \
      --output "./Client_Deliveries_Output/Johnson_Family" \
      --base-name "Johnson_Family_Portraits_Autumn2025_FinalSelection" \
      --originals-action copy \
      --create-jpgs-optimized --create-webp-optimized \
      --create-jpgs-compressed --no-webp-compressed \
      --skip-compressed-versions \
      --create-zip-archives \
      --workers 4 \
      --delivery-company "My Awesome Photography Studio" \
      --delivery-website "https://myawesomephotography.example.com" \
      --delivery-email "hello@myawesomephotography.example.com" \
      --verbose
    ```

3.  **Example of a High-Risk Operation: MOVE Originals, Strip ALL EXIF, No ZIPs.**
    **üõëüõëüõë WARNING: The `--originals-action move` flag IS DESTRUCTIVE. It will PERMANENTLY move files from your source location. ENSURE YOU HAVE RELIABLE, VERIFIED, AND INDEPENDENT BACKUPS *BEFORE* RUNNING ANY COMMAND WITH `--originals-action move`! Test this specific command *exhaustively* with `--dry-run` first, using non-critical sample data, to fully understand its implications.**
    ```bash
    # TRIPLE-CHECK YOUR BACKUPS AND DRY RUN RESULTS BEFORE EXECUTING A COMMAND LIKE THIS!
    python3 app.py cli \
      --source "D:\Temporary_Shoots\Project_Alpha_SourceFiles_ToBeMoved" \
      --output "E:\Secure_Client_Archives\Client_XYZ_Deliverables" \
      --base-name "Project_Alpha_Redacted_SecureDelivery_Q4_2025" \
      --originals-action move \
      --exif-policy strip_all \
      --no-jpgs-optimized --create-webp-optimized \ # Example: Only WebP for optimized
      --skip-compressed-versions \
      --no-zip-archives \
      --delivery-company "Top Secret Deliveries Inc." \
      --delivery-website "https://topsecret.example.com" \
      --delivery-email "contact-secure@topsecret.example.com" \
      --workers 2 \
      --dry-run --verbose # START WITH DRY RUN! Remove --dry-run ONLY when 1000% sure.
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Advanced Branding: Tailor PhotoPackager to Your Studio

PhotoPackager offers robust configuration options, allowing you to set persistent defaults and fine-tune its behavior to perfectly match your studio's unique workflow and branding requirements. This ensures consistency and saves time on every job.

### The Heart of Configuration: `config.py`

Located in the project's root directory (when running from source) or within the application bundle/installation folder (for packaged versions ‚Äì e.g., alongside `app.exe` or in `PhotoPackager_GUI.app/Contents/Resources/`), the `config.py` file is your central hub for establishing **application-wide defaults** and core **developer/studio identity**. It's highly recommended to review and edit this file *before* your first significant use of PhotoPackager, or any time you wish to change your standard operational procedures.

Changes to `config.py` will affect the default selections in the GUI and the default behavior of CLI commands if specific overriding arguments are not provided.

**Key Configurable Sections within `config.py`:**

*   **`USER_...` Variables (Your Studio's Default Identity):**
    These define the default branding information used in the client-facing `README.txt`.
    *   `USER_COMPANY_NAME = "Your Photography Studio"`: Set your official studio or company name.
    *   `USER_WEBSITE = "https://www.yourwebsite.com"`: Your primary website URL.
    *   `USER_SUPPORT_EMAIL = "support@yourwebsite.com"`: Your main support or client contact email address.

*   **`DEFAULT_...` Variables (Operational Defaults for GUI & CLI):**
    These control the pre-selected options in the GUI and the default behavior in the CLI if specific flags are omitted. Modify these to match your most common workflow, saving you clicks and keystrokes for each job. Examples include:
    *   `DEFAULT_ORIGINALS_ACTION = "copy"` (Options: `"copy"`, `"move"`, `"leave"`, `"skip_export"`)
    *   `DEFAULT_EXIF_POLICY = "keep"` (Options: `"keep"`, `"strip_all"`, `"date"`, `"camera"`, `"both"`)
    *   `DEFAULT_CREATE_JPGS_OPTIMIZED = True`
    *   `DEFAULT_CREATE_WEBP_OPTIMIZED = True`
    *   `DEFAULT_CREATE_JPGS_COMPRESSED = True`
    *   `DEFAULT_CREATE_WEBP_COMPRESSED = True`
    *   `DEFAULT_SKIP_COMPRESSED_VERSIONS = False`
    *   `DEFAULT_CREATE_ZIP_ARCHIVES = True`
    *   `DEFAULT_CLI_WORKERS = 0` (Value `0` typically means use system CPU count; set to a specific integer like `1`, `2`, `4` to fix the number of workers for the CLI.)

*   **Image Processing Parameters (Fine-tuning Quality & Size):**
    Control the output quality and dimensions of your processed images.
    *   `OPTIMIZED_JPG_QUALITY = 90` (Integer 0-100, higher is better quality but larger file size)
    *   `OPTIMIZED_WEBP_QUALITY = 85` (Integer 0-100 for lossy WebP, higher is better quality/larger file)
    *   `OPTIMIZED_WEBP_METHOD = 4` (Integer 0-6 for WebP encoding effort; higher is slower but often better compression/quality)
    *   `COMPRESSED_TARGET_PIXELS = 2000000` (Target total megapixels for compressed images, e.g., approx 1920x1080 or 2MP. Images are resized proportionally to not exceed this pixel count. Can also be set as `COMPRESSED_LONG_EDGE_PIXELS = 2048` or similar in some configurations).
    *   `COMPRESSED_JPG_QUALITY = 75`
    *   `COMPRESSED_WEBP_QUALITY = 70`
    *   `COMPRESSED_FALLBACK_QUALITY = 65` (Minimum quality for compressed JPEGs if adaptive quality algorithms struggle).

*   **Folder Names (`FOLDER_NAMES` Dictionary):**
    This dictionary allows you to customize the names of the output subdirectories created by PhotoPackager. For instance, you could change the default `"Optimized Files"` to `"High-Res_Client_Deliverables"` or `"Export Originals"` to `"Full_Resolution_Masters_Archive"`.
    Example structure:
    ```python
    FOLDER_NAMES = {
        "originals": "Export Originals",
        "optimized_parent": "Optimized Files",
        "optimized_jpg": "Optimized JPGs",
        "optimized_webp": "Optimized WebPs",
        "compressed_parent": "Compressed Files",
        "compressed_jpg": "Compressed JPGs",
        "compressed_webp": "Compressed WebPs"
    }
    ```
    **Caution:** Modifying these names should be done thoughtfully. While PhotoPackager will adapt internally, ensure your workflow, any downstream scripts, or client communication also recognize and align with these new names for consistency.

*   **UI & Logging Customization (Less Common):**
    *   `ANSI_COLORS`: (Primarily for CLI output) Customize console output colors for different log levels, enhancing readability or branding in terminal environments.
    *   Other UI-related defaults (e.g., window dimensions, theme settings if applicable) might also be configurable here depending on the PhotoPackager version.

### Per-Job Delivery Branding Overrides (GUI / CLI)

While `config.py` sets your *default* studio branding for client deliverables, PhotoPackager provides the crucial flexibility to override this on a **per-job basis**. This is essential for studios managing multiple brands, catering to specific client requests, or providing white-labeled deliveries.

As detailed in the "Usage" sections:
*   **GUI:** The dedicated "Delivery Branding" panel (often labeled "Client README Customization") allows you to enter a specific `Company Name`, `Website`, and `Support Email` for the current job being processed.
*   **CLI:** The `--delivery-company "Your Name"`, `--delivery-website "https://your.site"`, and `--delivery-email "contact@your.site"` arguments serve the exact same purpose for command-line operations.

This per-job branding information will be used to populate the client-facing `README.txt` file included in that specific delivery package, taking precedence over the global defaults from `config.py` for that particular run.

### Mandatory Attribution Notice ‚Äì A Note on Open Source Integrity

PhotoPackager is proudly released under the permissive MIT License, fostering a spirit of open source sharing and collaboration. The license requires that the original developer attribution (Steven Seagondollar, DropShock Digital LLC) remains present in the footer of the generated client-facing `README.txt` files and within the internal `photopackager_run.log` files.

Your custom Delivery Branding information (as set in `config.py` or overridden per-job) is featured prominently in the main body of the client `README.txt`, ensuring *your* brand is front-and-center for your clients, while respectfully acknowledging the open-source origins and core development of the tool.

## ‚ùó Warnings & Important Considerations: Use PhotoPackager Safely & Effectively

Please read these notes carefully to ensure a smooth, safe, and effective experience with PhotoPackager. Understanding these points can prevent data loss, frustration, and help you get the most out of the application.

*   **üõë `MOVE` ORIGINALS OPTION: PERMANENT & DESTRUCTIVE ‚Äì EXTREME CAUTION ADVISED!**
    The "Move Originals" option (available in the GUI dropdown for Originals Handling) or the `--originals-action move` flag (available in the CLI) will **PERMANENTLY DELETE** image files from their original source location after they are successfully moved to the output directory's `Export Originals` folder.
    *   **THERE IS NO UNDO FEATURE FOR THIS OPERATION WITHIN PHOTOPACKAGER.** Once moved and the source deleted, the files are gone from their original path unless you have external backups.
    *   **BEFORE EVER USING THE `move` OPTION:**
        1.  **Verify you have RELIABLE, INDEPENDENT, and RECENTLY TESTED backups of ALL your source images.** Multiple backup locations (e.g., another internal drive, an external drive, cloud backup) are strongly recommended. "Tested backups" means you have successfully restored files from them before.
        2.  Understand that if the `move` process is interrupted (e.g., power loss, system crash, user cancellation) or fails *after* some files have been moved but *before* all are processed, your files could be in a split state (some moved, some not).
        3.  **Always perform a `--dry-run` (CLI) or check "Perform Dry Run" (GUI) multiple times on non-critical, sample data to fully understand what will happen before using `move` on valuable, irreplaceable images.**
    *   **DropShock Digital LLC and its developers (Steven Seagondollar) are NOT liable for any data loss resulting from the use or misuse of this feature.** You use the `move` option entirely at your own risk. The `copy` option is the strongly recommended default for safety and peace of mind.

*   **üß™ ALWAYS USE `Dry Run` FOR TESTING CONFIGURATIONS:**
    Before processing critical client jobs, or any time you are unsure about settings, **always** utilize the Dry Run feature:
    *   **GUI:** Check the "Perform Dry Run (Simulate, No Changes)" box.
    *   **CLI:** Include the `--dry-run` flag in your command.
    A dry run simulates all actions (scanning, "renaming", "processing" without actual image manipulation, "packaging") and generates a detailed log (`photopackager_run.log` and console output) of what *would* have occurred. **No actual files will be created, moved, or deleted on your system during a dry run.** Carefully review this log to confirm the intended operations, file counts, paths, and renaming schemes before proceeding with a live, non-dry run. This is your safety net for experimenting with settings.

*   **üíæ Significant Disk Space Requirements:**
    PhotoPackager can generate multiple versions of your images (Originals, Optimized JPGs, Optimized WebPs, Compressed JPGs, Compressed WebPs) and, optionally, create ZIP archives for each of these categories. This means the final output package can consume considerable disk space ‚Äì potentially **2 to 5 times the size of your original shoot folder**, depending on the selected options and the nature of your source files.
    *   **Ensure you have adequate free disk space on your designated output drive *before* starting a large processing job.** Insufficient disk space can lead to errors, incomplete processing, and corrupted ZIP files.

*   **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Drive Syncing & Potential Conflicts:**
    Processing shoots directly from folders that are actively being synced by cloud storage services (e.g., OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud Drive, Box, etc.) can sometimes lead to unpredictable issues:
    *   **File Access Conflicts:** The cloud service might attempt to sync a file (upload changes, download updates, or check for modifications) while PhotoPackager is actively reading, writing, or moving it. This can lead to "file in use" errors, permission issues, or even corrupted output files if a file is modified mid-process.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Simultaneous syncing activity consumes network bandwidth and system resources (CPU, I/O), which can significantly slow down PhotoPackager's processing speed.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Syncing of partially written files, temporary files created by PhotoPackager, or log files could cause confusion or errors for both PhotoPackager and the sync client.
    *   **Recommendation for Best & Most Reliable Results:**
        1.  **Pause cloud sync services** for the source and output directories *before* starting PhotoPackager and resume them *after* processing is fully complete.
        2.  Alternatively, and often preferably, **work with local copies** of your shoot files that are *not* located in actively synced cloud folders. Process them locally, and then, once PhotoPackager has completed its job and you've verified the output, manually move or copy the final packaged shoot folder to your cloud-synced directory for backup or distribution.

*   **‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements & Performance Considerations:**
    *   **Operating System:**
        *   Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit strongly recommended for better performance and memory handling).
        *   macOS (typically versions like Big Sur 11.0+ are recommended for compatibility with modern Python and Qt; always check specific release notes for the PhotoPackager version you are using for precise OS compatibility).
    *   **Python (if running from source):** Version **3.12.10** or a compatible 3.12.x release is targeted.
    *   **Key Libraries:** `Pillow` (for image processing, version e.g., 11.x), `PySide6` (for GUI, Qt 6.x). See `requirements.txt` for a full list of Python dependencies.
    *   **CPU & RAM:** While PhotoPackager is designed to be efficient, processing very large images (e.g., >50 Megapixels) or huge batches of thousands of images will naturally benefit from a faster multi-core CPU and more RAM. 8GB of RAM is a good minimum, with 16GB+ recommended for very heavy or professional use. The CLI's multi-core processing (`--workers` option) can significantly improve speed on capable machines.
    *   **Hard Drive Speed:** Using SSDs (Solid State Drives) for both your source images and the output directory will noticeably improve performance compared to traditional HDDs, especially for I/O-intensive operations like copying large numbers of files and writing multiple processed versions.

*   **üñºÔ∏è WebP EXIF Metadata Nuances:**
    WebP is an excellent format for web use, offering good compression and quality. However, support for embedding *all* types of EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) metadata into WebP files by image processing libraries like `Pillow` can sometimes be less comprehensive or behave differently compared to more established formats like JPEG.
    *   While common EXIF tags (like camera model, date/time, basic exposure info) are often preserved, very specific, obscure, or proprietary maker notes within EXIF data might not always transfer perfectly to WebP.
    *   If retaining absolutely every nuance of EXIF data in your WebP output is critically important for your workflow, it is strongly recommended to conduct thorough tests with your specific image types and metadata requirements to verify the results.

*   **üö´ Corrupted or Unsupported Source Files:**
    PhotoPackager, through its use of the `Pillow` library, attempts to handle common image file issues gracefully. It will typically try to:
    *   Identify and skip image files that are severely corrupted or unreadable.
    *   Log a warning when a file is skipped due to being unreadable or of an unsupported format. PhotoPackager primarily focuses on common still image formats that Pillow can decode (e.g., JPG, PNG, TIFF, HEIC, and many common camera RAW formats via Pillow's capabilities or associated libraries if Pillow uses them).
    *   However, extremely damaged files, or exotic/proprietary image formats not natively supported by the version of `Pillow` being used, could potentially cause unexpected behavior, errors during processing, or even crashes in rare, unhandled cases within the underlying libraries.
    *   It's always good practice to ensure your source images are generally sound and, for critical workflows, are in commonly supported formats or have been pre-processed from very obscure RAW formats into DNG, TIFF, or high-quality JPEG if issues arise.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting / Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

If you encounter issues while using PhotoPackager, this section provides solutions to common problems. For more detailed diagnostics, always check the `photopackager_run.log` file generated in the output folder for the specific job that had issues. This log file is your primary source for error details.

1.  **Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PySide6'` (or `'PIL'`, `'Pillow'`, `'joblib'`, `'piexif'`, etc.) when trying to run from source.**
    *   **Cause:** The necessary Python dependencies for PhotoPackager are not installed in your current Python environment, or your Python virtual environment (`venv_photopackager` or `venv_mac`) is not active.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  Ensure you are in the PhotoPackager project's root directory in your terminal/command prompt.
        2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
            *   macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh): `source venv_photopackager/bin/activate` (or your venv name)
            *   Windows (Command Prompt): `venv_photopackager\Scripts\activate.bat`
            *   Windows (PowerShell): `.\venv_photopackager\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
        3.  Verify that `(venv_photopackager)` (or your venv name) appears at the beginning of your terminal prompt.
        4.  Re-install or install the dependencies using the correct pip for your Python 3.12 environment: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
        5.  If the error mentioned a specific optional library like `piexif` (and it's genuinely optional for your use case, though often core features might depend on it if listed in `requirements.txt`), you might try installing it explicitly: `python3 -m pip install piexif`. However, ensure all items in `requirements.txt` are installed first.

2.  **Error (macOS): `Command not found: python` or `Command not found: pip` when trying to set up or run from source.**
    *   **Cause:** On modern macOS, the command `python` often refers to an older, pre-installed Python 2 version (which is deprecated and not used by PhotoPackager), or it might not be mapped at all. Python 3 installations are typically invoked using `python3`.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Consistently use `python3` instead of `python` for all commands related to PhotoPackager (e.g., `python3 --version`, `python3 app.py`, `python3 main.py`, `python3 -m venv ...`).
        *   For `pip`, use `pip3` or, more reliably and explicitly, `python3 -m pip` (e.g., `python3 -m pip install <package_name>`, `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`). This ensures you are using the `pip` associated with your `python3` installation.

3.  **Error: "Permission Denied", "Access Denied", or "OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied" during file operations (reading source images, writing output files, creating folders).**
    *   **Cause:** Your current user account lacks the necessary read permissions for the selected source folder or write permissions for the chosen output parent directory (or its subdirectories). Active cloud sync services (OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.) can sometimes temporarily lock files or folders, leading to permission-like errors. Antivirus software might also, in rare cases, be overly aggressive and block PhotoPackager's file operations.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **Check Folder Permissions:** Verify and, if necessary, adjust folder permissions using your operating system's tools.
            *   On macOS: Select the folder in Finder, press `Cmd+I` (Get Info), expand the "Sharing & Permissions" section at the bottom, and ensure your user account has "Read & Write" privileges. You may need to click the lock icon and authenticate to make changes.
            *   On Windows: Right-click the folder in File Explorer, select "Properties," go to the "Security" tab, and check the permissions for your user account. Ensure you have "Full control" or at least "Read," "Write," and "Modify" permissions.
        *   **Test with Simple, Known-Writable Paths:** Try running a small test job with the output directed to a simple, known-writable local folder (e.g., `C:\Temp\PhotoPackager_TestOutput` on Windows or `~/Desktop/PhotoPackager_TestOutput` on macOS). This helps rule out issues with complex network paths, special characters in paths, or problematic cloud-synced locations.
        *   **Cloud Sync Interference:** Temporarily pause any cloud synchronization services that might be monitoring your source or output directories during PhotoPackager processing.
        *   **Antivirus Software:** As a temporary diagnostic step, you could try briefly disabling your antivirus software or adding PhotoPackager (the executable `app.exe` or `PhotoPackager_GUI.app`, and its installation folder) to its exclusion/whitelist. Remember to re-enable your antivirus or refine its settings afterward.
        *   **Avoid Running as Administrator/Root (Unless Absolutely Necessary and Understood):** While it might seem like a quick fix for permission errors, running applications with elevated (Administrator or root) privileges can sometimes create files and folders with ownership/permissions that are problematic for your regular user account to access or modify later. It's generally better to fix the underlying permission issue for your standard user account.

4.  **GUI Launches, but clicking "Start Processing" does nothing, the application hangs (becomes unresponsive), or it crashes.**
    *   **Cause:** This can indicate several potential issues:
        *   An unhandled error or exception in the backend processing logic.
        *   Invalid, inaccessible, or incorrectly formatted input/output paths.
        *   A resource issue (e.g., running out of memory when attempting to process extremely large images or an enormous number of files, though this is less common for simple hangs and more likely to result in a crash or system slowdown).
        *   A bug within PhotoPackager or one of its underlying libraries (like PySide6 or Pillow).
        *   The GUI mode in PhotoPackager, especially if image processing is done on the main thread (or if a background thread blocks the main thread), can hang if a long operation doesn't yield control back to the event loop.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  **Check the GUI Log Area First:** Immediately look at the scrollable log area within the PhotoPackager window. It often displays error messages, Python tracebacks, or other clues that appeared right after you clicked "Start Processing."
        2.  **Examine `photopackager_run.log` (Crucial Diagnostic Step):** Navigate to the output parent folder you specified in the GUI. Even if the process fails or hangs very early, PhotoPackager usually attempts to create a `photopackager_run.log` file (inside the shoot-specific subfolder it *would have* fully created, or sometimes directly in the parent if it fails before making the subfolder). This log file typically contains the most detailed error information, including a full Python traceback if an unhandled exception occurred. This is often the key to understanding the problem.
        3.  **Validate Paths Thoroughly:** Double-check, triple-check that your "Source Images Folder" and "Output Parent Folder" paths are absolutely correct, that they exist, that they are accessible by your user account, and that there are no typos or unusual/problematic characters in the paths.
        4.  **Simplify Your Test Case:** Try processing a *very small* set of known-good, common image files (e.g., 2-3 small JPEGs from your computer, not complex RAWs) into a new, simple output location (like a folder on your Desktop) with a very basic "Shoot Base Name" (e.g., `test`). This can help isolate whether the issue is related to your specific data, complex paths, or a more general software bug.
        5.  Ensure the final output directories (e.g., `.../YourShootBaseName/Optimized Files/Optimized JPGs/`) are actually writable by your current user account.

5.  **Output Folders (e.g., `Optimized Files`, `Compressed Files`, `Export Originals`) are empty or missing expected files after a run that reported "Done!".**
    *   **Cause:**
        *   **Dry Run Mode Was Active:** This is the most common reason. If "Perform Dry Run (Simulate, No Changes)" was checked in the GUI, or if the `--dry-run` flag was used in a CLI command, PhotoPackager would have simulated all actions but would *not* have actually written any files to the output folders.
        *   **Incorrect Processing Options Selected:**
            *   The relevant "Generate JPGs" / "Generate WebPs" options for the Optimized or Compressed categories might have been unchecked.
            *   The "Skip Compressed Versions" option might have been checked if you were expecting compressed files to be generated.
            *   The "Originals Handling" option might have been set to "Skip Export" (if you expected originals) or "Leave" (if you expected originals to be copied to the output but they were only left in the source).
        *   **No Matching or Processable Source Files:** If your selected source folder was empty, contained no image files, or only contained files in formats that PhotoPackager/Pillow could not recognize or process, then the output folders would naturally be empty.
        *   **Filtering Issues (Less Common in Standard Versions):** If your version of PhotoPackager has advanced file filtering options (e.g., based on filename patterns, metadata criteria) and these were misconfigured, it might have resulted in no files matching the criteria for processing.
        *   **Permissions Denied (Again):** While the main output folder might be writable, specific subdirectories might have encountered permission issues during creation or writing.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  **VERIFY DRY RUN IS OFF** for a live, productive run where you expect files to be created.
        2.  **Double-Check All Processing Options in the GUI (or CLI flags):** Carefully review every checkbox, dropdown menu selection, and input field to ensure they accurately reflect your desired output.
        3.  **Inspect `photopackager_run.log` Meticulously:** This log file is your best friend for diagnosing this. Look for:
            *   Messages indicating how many image files were found and identified in the source directory.
            *   For each file, look for specific success messages like "Successfully COPIED Original: [filename]", "Successfully SAVED Optimized JPG: [filename]", "Successfully SAVED Compressed WebP: [filename]", etc.
            *   If these success messages are missing for files you expected to be processed, look for preceding error messages, skipping notifications (e.g., "Skipping unreadable image: [filename]", "File [filename] does not match supported image types and was skipped."), or messages indicating that a category was skipped due to your options.
        4.  Ensure the final output directories (e.g., `.../YourShootBaseName/Optimized Files/Optimized JPGs/`) are actually writable by your current user account.

6.  **ZIP Files (`.zip`) are missing, empty, or incomplete after processing, even if "Create ZIP Archives" was enabled.**
    *   **Cause:**
        *   **"Create ZIP Archives" Option Was Disabled:** Double-check this setting.
        *   **Dry Run Mode Was Active:** ZIP archives are not created during a dry run.
        *   **Source Content Folders Are Empty:** This is a key point. ZIP creation depends on the corresponding content folders (`Export Originals`, `Optimized Files`, `Compressed Files`) existing *and actually containing files*. If these folders are empty (due to other settings like skipping categories, no source files matching, or errors preventing file population), then PhotoPackager might skip creating a ZIP for that empty category, or the ZIP file might be created but be empty.
        *   **Insufficient Disk Space:** Creating ZIP archives, especially for large sets of images, can require a significant amount of temporary disk space (often in your system's temporary directory, which might be on your primary system drive) before the final ZIP file is written to the designated output location.
        *   **Errors During the ZIP Creation Process Itself:** A specific error might have occurred while trying to add files to the archive (e.g., a file within a category was unreadable during the zipping process, though PhotoPackager usually processes them first and they should be readable).
        *   **Very Long File Paths Inside the ZIP Structure:** Extremely long internal file paths (the path of a file *within* the ZIP archive, which includes the base output folder names) can sometimes cause issues with older unzipping utilities on some operating systems, or if they exceed system limits. Modern OS versions and unzipping tools generally handle long paths much better, but it's a potential, albeit rarer, issue.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  Ensure the "Create ZIP Archives" option is enabled in the GUI (or the corresponding CLI flag is used) and that "Dry Run" mode is disabled.
        2.  **First, verify that the source content folders** (e.g., `Export Originals`, `Optimized Files/Optimized JPGs`) were correctly populated with the expected image files *before* you check the ZIP files. If the content folders are empty, you need to address that issue first (see FAQ #5).
        3.  Check the `photopackager_run.log` for any specific error messages logged during the "Creating ZIP archive for [CategoryName]..." phases. The log usually indicates the start and successful completion (or failure) for each ZIP file it attempts to create.
        4.  Ensure ample free disk space on both your system drive (for temporary files used during zipping) and on the drive where the output is being written.
        5.  Try to keep your "Shoot Base Name" and custom folder names (if configured in `config.py`) reasonably concise to avoid creating excessively long internal paths within the ZIP files, especially if delivering to clients who might use older systems or unzipping tools.

7.  **(Windows Specific) Desktop Notifications appear as standard pop-up message boxes, not as non-blocking "toast" notifications in the Action Center.**
    *   **Cause:** The optional `win10toast-reborn` Python library is either not installed in the Python environment PhotoPackager is using (if you are running from source), or it might not have been successfully bundled with the packaged application for that specific release. Additionally, Windows notification settings (like Focus Assist) might be configured to suppress notifications from new or specific apps.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **If running from source:** Ensure your virtual environment is active and try installing or reinstalling the library: `python3 -m pip install win10toast-reborn`.
        *   **If using the packaged version:** This library should ideally be bundled by the packager (PyInstaller). If toast notifications are not working, it might be an issue with that specific build or bundling process. You can also check your Windows "Settings > System > Notifications" and "Focus Assist" settings to ensure notifications are allowed for PhotoPackager (if it appears in the app list) or that Focus Assist isn't suppressing them. The standard pop-up message boxes are the default fallback mechanism and are still functional for conveying completion or error status.

**For persistent, complex, or unlisted issues, please gather the following information *before* seeking support from DropShock Digital LLC or reporting an issue on GitHub:**

*   Your **Operating System and its exact version** (e.g., Windows 11 Pro Version 23H2 OS Build 22631.xxxx, macOS Sonoma Version 14.3.1 (23D60)).
*   The **PhotoPackager version** you are using (this is often found in an "About" menu/dialog in the GUI, in the title of the release notes for the downloaded version, or can sometimes be inferred from the application's filename or properties).
*   **Clear, step-by-step instructions** on how to reliably reproduce the issue you are experiencing. The more detail, the better.
*   The **full and complete content of the `photopackager_run.log` file** from the specific processing job that encountered the problem. Please copy-paste the entire text of this log file or attach the file itself if submitting an issue.
*   **Screenshots** of the PhotoPackager GUI settings you used for the job, or the exact CLI command you ran.
*   **Screenshots of any error messages** that were displayed on screen (either in the GUI, a pop-up dialog, or in the console if using CLI).
*   A brief but clear description of the **expected behavior** (what you thought PhotoPackager should do) versus the **actual behavior** you observed.

Providing this comprehensive information upfront will greatly help in diagnosing and resolving your issue much more quickly and efficiently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Setup (For Contributors & Advanced Modification)

If you plan to contribute to PhotoPackager's development, debug issues at a code level, run the test suite, or customize the application beyond the standard configuration options, this section outlines the typical development setup.

1.  **Prerequisites & Cloning:**
    *   Ensure you have **Python 3.12.10** (or a compatible 3.12.x version) and **Git** installed.
    *   Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/seagpt/PhotoPackager.git
        cd PhotoPackager
        ```

2.  **Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):**
    Create and activate a Python virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Using the project name in the venv name is a good practice.
    *   **macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv_photopackager 
        source venv_photopackager/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv_photopackager
        .\venv_photopackager\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```

3.  **Install Core & Development Dependencies:**
    PhotoPackager typically has a `requirements.txt` for runtime dependencies and may have a `requirements-dev.txt` for development tools.
    ```bash
    # With venv active:
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    # If requirements-dev.txt exists and you need tools like pytest, pylint, mypy:
    # python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt 
    ```

4.  **Project Structure Overview (Key Files & Directories):**
    Understanding the project's layout is crucial for development. The structure typically includes:
    *   `PhotoPackager/` (Project Root)
        *   `app.py`: **Main application entry point for the GUI and CLI.** This script initializes the Qt application and shows the main window or handles CLI commands.
        *   `config.py`: Contains default configurations for the application (user settings, processing parameters, folder names).
        *   `core/`: Directory for core, non-GUI application logic.
            *   `__init__.py`: Makes `core` a Python package.
            *   `job_worker.py`: Likely handles the background processing of photo packaging jobs, including image operations, file handling, and communication with the GUI (e.g., via signals/slots if using Qt).
            *   `utils.py`: Contains common utility functions used across different parts of the application (e.g., logging setup, path manipulation, helper functions).
            *   Other modules for specific logic domains.
        *   `gui/`: Directory for all PySide6 (Qt) GUI components.
            *   `__init__.py`: Makes `gui` a Python package.
            *   `main_window.py`: Defines the main application window class, its layout, widgets, and event handling logic.
            *   Dialog files (e.g., `about_dialog.py`, `settings_dialog.py`, `log_viewer_dialog.py`): Define specific dialog windows used by the application.
            *   `update_checker.py`: (If present) Logic for checking for application updates.
        *   `assets/`: Contains static application assets such as logos (`PhotoPackager_Patch_Design.png`, `(White) DropShock Digital - Photography Watermark Version 2.png`), icons, UI elements, and potentially sample images for testing.
        *   `filesystem.py`: (If a distinct top-level file) May encapsulate more complex file system operations like advanced directory scanning, robust file copying/moving with error handling, and ZIP archive creation logic.
        *   `image_processing.py`: (If a distinct top-level file) Could house the core image manipulation functions using Pillow (resizing, format conversion, quality adjustments, EXIF handling).
        *   `job.py`: (If a distinct top-level file) Might define data structures or classes for representing and managing processing jobs, their parameters, and status.
        *   `tests/`: Contains unit tests, integration tests, and any necessary test fixtures or sample data (though larger test assets might still be in `assets/`).
        *   `venv_photopackager/` (or `venv_mac/`): The Python virtual environment directory (should be in `.gitignore`).
        *   `LICENSE.md`: The MIT License file.
        *   `README.md`: This project documentation file.
        *   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
        *   Build-related files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py` if used by PyInstaller or for packaging).

5.  **Running the Application in Development Mode:**
    With the virtual environment active, from the project root directory:
    *   **Run GUI:**
        ```bash
        python3 app.py
        # For enhanced Qt debugging output, which can be very helpful for GUI issues:
        python3 app.py --debug_qt 
        ```
    *   **Run CLI:**
        ```bash
        python3 app.py cli --source <test_source_path> --output <test_output_path> [options...]
        ```

6.  **Running Tests (Example using `pytest`):**
    If the project uses `pytest` for testing (common in modern Python projects):
    ```bash
    # Ensure pytest is installed (usually via requirements-dev.txt)
    # From the project root, with venv active:
    python3 -m pytest tests/

    # To get test coverage information (if pytest-cov is configured):
    # python3 -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html  (generates an HTML coverage report)
    # python3 -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing (shows missing lines in terminal)
    ```
    **Note on Test Assets:** Tests, especially those involving image processing, often require real image files. These should be placed in the `assets/` directory (or a subfolder like `assets/test_images/`). It's generally advised to use actual, small, representative image files (JPG, PNG, WebP, a few sample RAWs if RAW processing is tested) rather than trying to generate test images dynamically with Pillow, as dynamic generation can sometimes bypass or not fully exercise Pillow's file format plugin loading mechanisms.

7.  **Linting and Type Checking (Optional but Recommended for Code Quality):**
    If the project uses linters like `Pylint` or `Flake8`, and type checkers like `MyPy`:
    ```bash
    # Example with Pylint (configuration often in .pylintrc):
    # python3 -m pylint src/ gui/ core/ app.py main.py 

    # Example with MyPy (configuration often in pyproject.toml or mypy.ini):
    # python3 -m mypy src/ gui/ core/ app.py main.py 
    ```

8.  **Building Executables:**

    PhotoPackager uses PyInstaller for creating standalone executables. Dedicated packaging scripts simplify this process.

    *   **üçé macOS (.app and .dmg):**
        1.  Ensure all dependencies from `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt` are installed in your virtual environment.
        2.  Run the macOS packaging script:
            ```bash
            python macos_package.py
            ```
        3.  This script will:
            *   Generate a `.spec` file tailored for macOS.
            *   Run PyInstaller to create the `PhotoPackager_GUI.app` bundle in the `dist` folder.
            *   If `create-dmg` is installed and found, it will then create a `PhotoPackager_GUI.dmg` in the `dist` folder.
        4.  The final distributables (`.app` and `.dmg`) will be in the `dist/` directory.

    *   **ü™ü Windows (.exe):**
        (Instructions for a `windows_package.py` would go here if available. For a manual PyInstaller approach, ensure you include necessary data files, icons, and use a spec file for consistency.)
        A basic PyInstaller command example (adapt as needed, preferably use a spec file):
        ```bash
